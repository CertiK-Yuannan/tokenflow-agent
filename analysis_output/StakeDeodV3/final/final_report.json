Later, when availableAmountForClaim is computed inside withdrawTokensV3, the calculation uses the manipulated monthlyPercentage (and referral bonus) to compute an available claimable amount that is vastly higher than the original deposit. In effect, the attacker can deposit a small amount and, after waiting the minimal required period (or exploiting the referral bonus immediately), withdraw a multiple of the deposited tokens\u2014draining tokens held in the contract.",

By setting these values to extreme numbers, the withdrawal formula ends up returning a claimable amount that far exceeds the original deposit amount. Since these sensitive parameters are solely in the hands of the admin, if that role is compromised or abused, a malicious admin can orchestrate a scenario where depleting the contract's tokens through withdrawals becomes trivial.

Then when the attacker (or a colluding user) stakes tokens through stakeTokensV3, the deposit\u2019s monthlyPercentage field is recorded with this huge bonus. When availableAmountForClaim is calculated, the multiplier (the number of full 30\u2011day periods multiplied by an inflated per\u2011month bonus) results in an available balance that far exceeds the original deposit.

Because the calculation multiplies the deposit amount by the bonus percentage (divided by a constant 1000) and by the number of full 30\u2011day periods that have elapsed, any extreme value inserted by the admin immediately scales up the claimable payout.

In a normally secured system, the admin would set reasonable limits, thereby preventing the abuse. An attacker outside of admin control cannot force high bonus percentages\u2014they can only choose a _days value that the admin has already misconfigured.
