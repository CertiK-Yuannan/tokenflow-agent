      "attack_scenario": "An attacker who controls two addresses can abuse the referral bonus mechanism. In stakeTokensV3 the bonus for a valid referrer is credited directly to the referrer\u2019s account (either in users[...] or stakeReferal mapping) and later added in availableAmountForClaim during withdrawal. The bonus is computed purely as a fraction of the staked amount of the referred deposit and is not \u2018backed\u2019 by any separate deposit. By carefully using one address (Account A) as a referrer and another (Account B) to perform a substantial deposit with Account A named as referrer, the attacker can eventually withdraw more tokens than originally deposited. In effect, Account B locks tokens in the contract while Account A (which only ever did a minimal self\u2010stake to be \u201cvalid\u201d) can withdraw the referral bonus\u2014thus \u201ccreating\u201d extra token flow in a coordinated sequence.",
      "exploit_code": "Step 1 (Prepare referrer):\n  \u2022 Using account A (the planned referrer), perform a minimal stake (for example, deposit 1 token with any valid stakingDays) so that userStakedStatus[A] becomes TRUE.\n\nStep 2 (Exploit referral bonus):\n  \u2022 From account B (the attacker\u2019s second account), call stakeTokensV3 with parameters:\n      tokenAmount = X (a relatively large amount, say 100 tokens),\n      referrer = account A,\n      stakingDays = D (choose D such that getReferalBonusFromDays[D] is nonzero, possibly a value that is allowed by the admin\u2019s configuration).\n  \u2022 Because account A is now already a staker and caller B is not equal to account A, the code branches into the first condition, and the referral bonus is computed as:\n       bonus = (X * getReferalBonusFromDays[D]) / 1000\n     and added to users[A].referalEarning.\n\nStep 3 (Withdrawal by referrer):\n  \u2022 After waiting any necessary short period (or even immediately if the bonus does not depend on elapsed time) account A invokes withdrawTokensV3, which calls availableAmountForClaim(A) and returns the bonus amount in addition to any minor amount from its own (minimal) deposit record.\n\nStep 4 (Profit):\n  \u2022 Because account A\u2019s deposit was negligible, the withdrawal amount from account A is mostly the bonus generated by account B\u2019s deposit. The tokens withdrawn come from the contract\u2019s balance \u2013 which only consists of tokens deposited by stakers \u2013 so the attacker effectively extracts extra tokens that were never truly \u2018backed\u2019 by a matching deposit from account A.",
      "profit_mechanism": "The referral bonus is computed as a percentage of a staker\u2019s deposit and credited separately to the referrer\u2019s record. By using two colluding accounts, the attacker makes account B deposit a relatively large amount while receipt of the bonus by account A (which did a trivial stake merely to qualify) allows them to later withdraw the bonus \u2013 thereby withdrawing more tokens from the contract than were deposited overall. The attacker, controlling both sides, is able to reassemble these funds to end up with both the bonus and, eventually, both staked amounts, effectively profiting extra tokens out of the token flow.",
      "attack_prerequisites": "\u2022 Attacker must control two addresses, one that can be registered as a staker (Account A) and one that will deposit a significant token amount (Account B).\n\u2022 The referral bonus mapping (getReferalBonusFromDays) must be set to yield a nonzero bonus for the chosen stakingDays value. This may depend on admin configuration, but if the bonus percentage is nontrivial then the attack is profitable.\n\u2022 The external check (checkUserStakedStatus) must return a positive status for the referrer (which is ensured by staking a minimal amount from Account A beforehand).",
      "attack_limitations": "\u2022 The attack assumes that the admin\u2010defined bonus percentages (both for monthly bonus and referral bonus) are not capped or controlled so that the referral bonus becomes significant relative to the deposit amount. If these values are set very low then the profit may be neglible.\n\u2022 If there are any off-chain or on-chain limits (for example, restrictions on the range of valid stakingDays) those could limit the ability to choose an optimal staking period for maximum bonus.\n\u2022 The contract funds come solely from tokens deposited by stakers. If many users stake legitimately, there may be other withdrawal claims that compete, possibly reducing available balance. However, in an isolated attack scenario the attacker can control the relative amounts.",
      "edge_cases": "\u2022 If stakingDays is forced to be one of a few allowed values (set by admin) then the attacker may not be able to choose a value that maximizes bonus extraction.\n\u2022 If the admin sets the referral bonus percentages to zero or extremely low values, the incentive to perform the referral attack is reduced.\n\u2022 If additional state updates were later added to mark deposits as \u2018claimed\u2019 (which are not present in the pseudo\u2010code) it would likely prevent repeated withdrawals of the bonus.\n\u2022 The external dependency for token transfer (IERC20.safeTransfer) is assumed not to be reentrant. If it were upgraded or replaced with one that allowed reentrancy, further exploits might be possible but are outside the current scope.",
      "confidence": "high",
      "reasons_if_not_feasible": "",
      "reasoning": "The attack stems from the fact that the contract separately credits referral bonuses based solely on the deposit value provided by any staker who names a valid referrer. Since referral earnings are stored in either users[referrer].referalEarning or stakeReferal[referrer] and then added (without considering any \u2018backing\u2019 by a separate deposit) when computing the total available withdrawal amount, an attacker controlling both the referrer and the staker accounts can induce a non\u2010backed bonus. The sequence is feasible because (1) the staker\u2019s deposit is accepted and recorded before token transfer (but the token transfer itself is done with safe functions that do not permit reentrancy, per our assumptions), (2) the referral bonus calculation uses a user-controlled stakingDays (subject to admin mapping) and deposit token amount, and (3) the withdrawal simply subtracts the total withdrawn amount from a sum that includes the bonus, allowing the bonus to be \u201ccashed out\u201d once. In a real exploit the attacker deposits a small amount from the referrer (just enough to qualify) and a large amount from the staker, thereby extracting a healthy referral bonus that is effectively extra tokens from the contract.",

      "goal_met": true,
      "evaluation": "The finding correctly identifies that the referral bonus is computed entirely as a fraction of the staked amount and credited to the referrer, without requiring a separate deposit from the referrer. An attacker controlling two addresses (one with a minimal stake to qualify as an active staker and another to make a massive deposit while naming the first as referrer) can indeed cause the contract to record a bonus that is not properly 'backed' by an independent deposit from the referrer. When the referrer later calls withdrawTokensV3, the bonus (aggregated from users[_referrer].referalEarning and stakeReferal) is added to any minimal yield from their negligible self-stake. Thus, the contract will allow the withdrawal of an amount which exceeds what the referrer actually staked, effectively extracting extra tokens from the contract pool. The analysis is sound because the attack does not require any exotic conditions: it simply leverages the fact that the referral bonus calculation uses the staker\u2019s deposit amount (and any carried forward bonus) and credits that result, and the contract does not introduce any checks tying that payout to an equivalent backing deposit from the referrer.",
      "critical_flaws": "None. The bug as described is genuine. The contract logic in stakeTokensV3 and availableAmountForClaim overlooks the possibility of using one address to generate a bonus for another without requiring real backing of funds on the referrer side.",
      "overlooked_constraints": "The attack scenario assumes that the admin has not set the referral bonus percentages to trivial values. It also assumes that the external call to checkUserStakedStatus reliably returns a positive result for a minimal stake. No additional off\u2010chain or on\u2010chain constraints (like capping of bonus withdrawals or linked deposit tracking) have been implemented, reinforcing this vulnerability. Moreover, since the referral bonus is not time locked by any additional mechanism, it can be withdrawn immediately.",

Since the bonus is directly calculated as a ratio of the deposit and no extra multipliers or state inconsistencies are introduced, there is no mechanism for an attacker to extract tokens in excess of what was deposited plus the precisely computed bonus. Furthermore, the withdrawal process records the withdrawn amount to prevent any double-withdrawal issues. Even when considering nuances such as deposits with non\u2010multiple-of\u201030 time periods or potential rounding issues, the attacker does not gain any advantage, as these only reduce the bonus in some cases rather than inflate it.

When a user calls stakeTokensV3, the deposit record is created with depositAmount and timePeriodInDays directly provided by the user. This forms the basis of future bonus accrual and withdrawal calculations.\n\n2. The referral bonus is computed and added (either directly to users[referrer].referalEarning or via addReferalEarning) which increases the eventual claimable token amount.\n\n3. The safeTransferFrom dependency ensures that tokens are securely moved from the user into the contract, thereby \u201clocking\u201d the stake.\n\n4. When withdrawing via withdrawTokensV3, the contract iterates over each deposit. It uses depositAmount and timePeriodInDays (to compute maturity months) along with the monthly percentage to calculate available tokens. Finally, safeTransfer is used to send tokens out of the contract, ensuring proper token flow.\n\nThis pseudo-code outlines the main normal execution path and illustrates how the specified variables and dependencies interact in the token flow.",

        "reasons_if_not_feasible": "After a detailed review of the pseudo\u2010code, no flaw was found that would allow an attacker to increase the token flow in their favor. The staking and withdrawal logic use deposit information provided by the user in a manner that is later validated by time\u2010based accrual calculations. In addition, the use of SafeERC20 methods (safeTransferFrom and safeTransfer) protects against reentrancy attacks given the assumption that these token methods are not externally manipulable. Although the deposit record is created before calling safeTransferFrom, a failure in token transfer would revert the entire transaction, preventing any inconsistency. Referral bonuses are calculated based on admin\u2010defined mappings and incorporate an external validity check. In all cases the computations and state updates (including tracking of withdrawn amounts) occur in a way that precludes an exploitable gap.  ",
        "reasoning": "1. In stakeTokensV3 the deposit record is created using the user\u2010supplied amount and stakeDays. Although these values determine future bonus calculations, the admin controls the percentage mappings (releasePercentageFromDays and getReferalBonusFromDays) so that excessive bonuses cannot be acquired unless the admin misconfigures them.\n2. The referral earnings update is subject to an external validation (referrerIsValid) to ensure that self-referral is not allowed and that only valid referrers benefit.\n3. Tokens are transferred using safeTransferFrom, and any failure (or potential issues in nonstandard tokens) would revert the transaction, so no deposit record is left orphaned.\n4. In withdrawTokensV3, the bonus accrual is computed on\u2010the\u2010fly based on elapsed time and prior withdrawal data (using the withdrawnAmount mapping). This cumulative calculation ensures that even multiple withdrawals will only provide what has actually accrued from the deposit and referral earnings.\n5. The safeTransfer dependency (used to pay out tokens) is assumed to be secure and non\u2010manipulable since it does not rely on the low-level .call method, so reentrancy or similar vulnerabilities are not applicable per the analysis assumptions.\n6. Although the state update for withdrawnAmount occurs after safeTransfer, given that the external token call is via a safeIERC20 library function and the assumption that external dependencies are secure, the order of operations does not introduce an exploitable reentrancy risk.\n\nBased on these points and under the stated assumptions, all inputs, state updates, and external calls occur in a controlled fashion making an exploit for profit infeasible.",

The review shows that all critical state variables are updated before external calls where possible, and that the use of SafeERC20 functions effectively mitigates potential reentrancy risks (assuming that the underlying ERC20 token is standard and non\u2010malicious). The stakeTokensV3 function creates the deposit record before the token transfer, and the bonus/reward calculations are based on admin\u2010controlled percentage mappings. The withdrawal function correctly calculates the available claimable amount based on the deposit\u2019s accrued bonus and subtracts any previously withdrawn value. Although the state update in withdrawTokensV3 happens after the external safeTransfer call, under the assumption that the token contract behaves according to standard ERC20 practices (i.e. does not trigger reentrancy), this ordering does not create a viable attack vector.

The bonus is computed purely as a fraction of the staked amount of the referred deposit and is not \u2018backed\u2019 by any separate deposit. By carefully using one address (Account A) as a referrer and another (Account B) to perform a substantial deposit with Account A named as referrer, the attacker can eventually withdraw more tokens than originally deposited. In effect, Account B locks tokens in the contract while Account A (which only ever did a minimal self\u2010stake to be \u201cvalid\u201d) can withdraw the referral bonus\u2014thus \u201ccreating\u201d extra token flow in a coordinated sequence.",

The tokens withdrawn come from the contract\u2019s balance \u2013 which only consists of tokens deposited by stakers \u2013 so the attacker effectively extracts extra tokens that were never truly \u2018backed\u2019 by a matching deposit from account A.",
        "profit_mechanism": "The referral bonus is computed as a percentage of a staker\u2019s deposit and credited separately to the referrer\u2019s record. By using two colluding accounts, the attacker makes account B deposit a relatively large amount while receipt of the bonus by account A (which did a trivial stake merely to qualify) allows them to later withdraw the bonus \u2013 thereby withdrawing more tokens from the contract than were deposited overall. The attacker, controlling both sides, is able to reassemble these funds to end up with both the bonus and, eventually, both staked amounts, effectively profiting extra tokens out of the token flow.",
        "attack_prerequisites": "\u2022 Attacker must control two addresses, one that can be registered as a staker (Account A) and one that will deposit a significant token amount (Account B).\n\u2022 The referral bonus mapping (getReferalBonusFromDays) must be set to yield a nonzero bonus for the chosen stakingDays value. This may depend on admin configuration, but if the bonus percentage is nontrivial then the attack is profitable.\n\u2022 The external check (checkUserStakedStatus) must return a positive status for the referrer (which is ensured by staking a minimal amount from Account A beforehand).",
        "attack_limitations": "\u2022 The attack assumes that the admin\u2010defined bonus percentages (both for monthly bonus and referral bonus) are not capped or controlled so that the referral bonus becomes significant relative to the deposit amount. If these values are set very low then the profit may be neglible.\n\u2022 If there are any off-chain or on-chain limits (for example, restrictions on the range of valid stakingDays) those could limit the ability to choose an optimal staking period for maximum bonus.\n\u2022 The contract funds come solely from tokens deposited by stakers. If many users stake legitimately, there may be other withdrawal claims that compete, possibly reducing available balance. However, in an isolated attack scenario the attacker can control the relative amounts.",
        "edge_cases": "\u2022 If stakingDays is forced to be one of a few allowed values (set by admin) then the attacker may not be able to choose a value that maximizes bonus extraction.\n\u2022 If the admin sets the referral bonus percentages to zero or extremely low values, the incentive to perform the referral attack is reduced.\n\u2022 If additional state updates were later added to mark deposits as \u2018claimed\u2019 (which are not present in the pseudo\u2010code) it would likely prevent repeated withdrawals of the bonus.\n\u2022 The external dependency for token transfer (IERC20.safeTransfer) is assumed not to be reentrant.

        "reasoning": "The attack stems from the fact that the contract separately credits referral bonuses based solely on the deposit value provided by any staker who names a valid referrer. Since referral earnings are stored in either users[referrer].referalEarning or stakeReferal[referrer] and then added (without considering any \u2018backing\u2019 by a separate deposit) when computing the total available withdrawal amount, an attacker controlling both the referrer and the staker accounts can induce a non\u2010backed bonus. The sequence is feasible because (1) the staker\u2019s deposit is accepted and recorded before token transfer (but the token transfer itself is done with safe functions that do not permit reentrancy, per our assumptions), (2) the referral bonus calculation uses a user-controlled stakingDays (subject to admin mapping) and deposit token amount, and (3) the withdrawal simply subtracts the total withdrawn amount from a sum that includes the bonus, allowing the bonus to be \u201ccashed out\u201d once. In a real exploit the attacker deposits a small amount from the referrer (just enough to qualify) and a large amount from the staker, thereby extracting a healthy referral bonus that is effectively extra tokens from the contract.",

An attacker controlling two addresses (one with a minimal stake to qualify as an active staker and another to make a massive deposit while naming the first as referrer) can indeed cause the contract to record a bonus that is not properly 'backed' by an independent deposit from the referrer. When the referrer later calls withdrawTokensV3, the bonus (aggregated from users[_referrer].referalEarning and stakeReferal) is added to any minimal yield from their negligible self-stake. Thus, the contract will allow the withdrawal of an amount which exceeds what the referrer actually staked, effectively extracting extra tokens from the contract pool. The analysis is sound because the attack does not require any exotic conditions: it simply leverages the fact that the referral bonus calculation uses the staker\u2019s deposit amount (and any carried forward bonus) and credits that result, and the contract does not introduce any checks tying that payout to an equivalent backing deposit from the referrer.",

        "evaluation": "The analysis is sound. The referral bonus mechanism is indeed vulnerable to manipulation. In stakeTokensV3 the bonus is computed in two different branches depending on two ways to verify the referrer\u2019s stake status \u2013 one branch checks the local flag (userStakedStatus) and directly updates users[referrer].referalEarning, while the other (else\u2010if) uses an external call to check stake status and then calls addReferalEarning to update stakeReferal. Both these storage variables are later summed when a user calls availableAmountForClaim, meaning that an attacker controlling multiple depositors can deliberately have the referrer credited in both mappings. Moreover, the referral bonus is not subject to any separate vesting schedule, so once credited the bonus is immediately available. In practice, an attacker can deploy several EOAs to make small deposits using a pre\u2010staked referrer account and thereby \u201cdouble\u2010dip\u201d the bonus \u2013 effectively receiving extra tokens on top of what the underlying deposits warrant.",
        "critical_flaws": "There are no critical flaws in the analysis that would invalidate the vulnerability. The control flow indeed allows crediting the bonus to two different storage locations and both are summed at withdrawal time. The external dependency and the admin\u2010controlled bonus percentages do not remove the attack vector under the stated assumptions.",
        "overlooked_constraints": "The attacker does need to control several EOAs and front-load deposit amounts, but gas or transaction fees do not negate the profit potential. The analysis correctly assumes that the admin\u2010controlled bonus percentages remain nonzero and that the external check (ICheckStakeUser) cooperates with the alternating bonus crediting strategy.",
