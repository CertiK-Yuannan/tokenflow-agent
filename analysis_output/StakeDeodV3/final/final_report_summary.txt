VULNERABILITY FOUND
Type: Bonus parameter manipulation due to unbounded _days input
Confidence: high

ATTACK SCENARIO:
When a staker calls stakeTokensV3 the user controls both the token deposit (which is secured by an actual token transfer) and the staking duration _days. The contract uses the _days value as a key into mappings releasePercentageFromDays and getReferalBonusFromDays to compute both the per‐month bonus and referral bonus. Since there is no validation on _days (for example, a maximum duration imposed) the admin–or any party if the admin misconfigures these mappings – may have set unusually high bonus percentages for some key _days values. An attacker can then deliberately deposit a large tokenAmount using such an abnormal _days value so that the computed matured bonus (and referral bonus, if they involve controlled referral addresses) becomes very high. In short, by choosing a duration that maps to an unexpectedly high bonus percentage, the calculated availableAmountForClaim becomes far higher than the tokens actually staked, allowing withdrawal of far more tokens than intended.

PROFIT MECHANISM:
The attacker’s profit arises because the monthly bonus is computed as a fixed fraction (using releasePercentageFromDays) on the deposited tokens. If an unreasonably high bonus percentage is set for a chosen _days value, then even an early withdrawal (based on the number of 30‐day increments elapsed) will return more tokens than were ever deposited. Combined with an inflated referral bonus (if the attacker arranges for referrals using either colluding accounts or misconfigurations in the referral logic), this can lead to a net profit wherein the withdrawal amount far exceeds the attacker’s original outlay, draining the contract’s token balance.

EXPLOIT CODE/SEQUENCE:
1. Admin (or a contract deployer with privileged access) sets, for example:
   
   setReleasePercentageV3(1000000, 10000); // 10x bonus per month over an extreme period
   setReferalPercentageFromDaysV3(1000000, 5000);

2. An attacker then deposits using the abnormal duration:
   
   // Attacker calls:
   stakeTokensV3(1000 * 1e18, legitimateReferrerAddress, 1000000);

   // After waiting for one (or a few) 30-day periods, availableAmountForClaim will calculate:
   // numberOfMonths = (block.timestamp - depositTimestamp) / 30 days (likely 1 if withdrawn early)
   // perMonthsMaturity = (1000*1e18 * 10000) / 1000 = 10000*1e18
   // available bonus = 1 * 10000*1e18 = 10000*1e18

   // Thus, the computed available amount equals the bonus (or adds the principal if sufficiently matured),
   // allowing an early withdrawal of a value that far exceeds the actual deposit of 1000 tokens.

3. The attacker calls withdrawTokensV3(attackerAddress) and receives an inflated token balance.

EVALUATION:
The finding correctly identifies an area where the design allows an attacker to pick any _days value at staking time, which in turn is used as a key into the bonus mappings (releasePercentageFromDays and getReferalBonusFromDays). These mappings are only settable by the admin, so under normal circumstances the bonus percentages should be set to sensible values. However, if an admin inadvertently or maliciously sets an extremely high bonus for a specific _days key, an attacker can indeed choose that same _days value when staking tokens. The bonus calculation in availableAmountForClaim will then multiply the deposit amount by an abnormally high percentage over even one period, allowing the withdrawal of a token amount that far exceeds the original deposit. In this sense the logic does create a vulnerability if the parameters are not properly bounded or validated (i.e. there is no enforced maximum value for _days or checks on the corresponding bonus percentages).
