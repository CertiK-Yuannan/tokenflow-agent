VULNERABILITY FOUND
Type: collusive referral abuse / economic manipulation
Confidence: high

ATTACK SCENARIO:
An attacker who controls multiple addresses can abuse the referral‐bonus mechanism by using one account (the 'master' referrer) and many other controlled accounts (the 'depositors'). The attack works as follows. First the attacker makes a small legitimate stake with the master referrer account so that the checkUserStakedStatus(_referrer) (or the userStakedStatus flag) passes. Then, using a collusive depositor account that holds sufficient tokens, the attacker calls stakeTokensV3 with a chosen deposit amount and listing the master referrer as _referrer. The referral bonus is computed as bonus = (depositAmount * bonusPercentage) / divider and, rather than being deducted from the deposit, is simply added to the master referrer’s referral earnings. When the depositor later claims its matured deposit (which returns the entire principal plus interest according to the release schedule), the extra bonus “reward” credited to the master account is paid out on top. In effect, the attacker is not risking funds because the deposit principal is returned, and yet they are able to repeatedly trigger extra bonus rewards.

PROFIT MECHANISM:
The attacker’s profit comes from the extra tokens credited to the master referrer account as referral earnings. Because the referral bonus is computed on every deposit made by any account that supplies A as the referrer, and because the deposit funds are eventually returned (with any fixed yield) to the depositor, the net effect is that bonus tokens are paid out in addition to returning staked amounts. Thus, if an attacker deposits repeatedly using collusive accounts, the aggregate bonus can be large relative to the actual net cost (after receiving back the staked capital).

EXPLOIT CODE/SEQUENCE:
Transaction Sequence:
// Step 1. Prepare master account (Account A) by staking a minimal amount to satisfy the referral condition
A → stakeTokensV3(minimalAmount, someReferrer, _days);
// (Assume now userStakedStatus[A] = true, or that checkUserStakedStatus(A) returns success.)

// Step 2. For each depositor account under attacker's control (Account B, Account C, ...):
B → stakeTokensV3( depositAmount, A, _days );
// The contract will execute:
//   if (userStakedStatus[A] && B ≠ A) { bonus = (depositAmount * getReferalBonusFromDays[_days]) / 1000
//      users[A].referalEarning += bonus }
// Step 3. Wait until maturity; each depositor then claims its tokens:
B → claimTokens();
// Withdrawals return B's stake plus any yield but do not reduce A's referral earnings.
// Finally, Account A claims its accumulated referral bonuses:
A → claimTokens();

REASONING:
Reviewing the pseudo-code step-by-step reveals that when a valid _referrer is supplied and the conditions (userStakedStatus or external check) are met, the contract credits bonus referral earnings to that referrer without deducting the bonus from the depositor’s stake. Given that the deposited tokens are later returned (along with any yield computed based on the deposit record), the referral bonus is an extra reward mechanism. An attacker who controls multiple accounts can use one account (ensuring it qualifies as a referrer) and then have multiple depositor accounts each stake tokens using that account as the referrer. As a consequence, the attacker ultimately receives all of the referral bonus rewards in addition to the return of each staked deposit. The economic arbitrage emerges because the bonus is ‘free’ extra tokens not coming out of the depositor’s funds. Detailed examination shows no inherent check limiting bonus accumulation, so provided that the bonus rate is nontrivial, repeated exploitation yields net profit. All the steps in the pseudo-code are feasible under typical ERC20 and staking conditions, so the vulnerability is practical.

EVALUATION:
The finding is legitimate. The referral mechanism in stakeTokensV3 is vulnerable to collusive abuse. An attacker can set up a minimal stake from a master account so that the userStakedStatus flag (or the external check by ICheckStakeUser) passes. Then, when one or more other controlled depositor accounts stake tokens using the master account as the referrer, the contract computes a referral bonus based on the deposit amount (with a bonus rate taken from getReferalBonusFromDays and a divisor of 1000) and credits it directly to the master account’s referral earnings. Since the depositor eventually gets back its entire principal and yield, the bonus is essentially “free” extra tokens. The bonus calculation itself is flawed because it uses the depositor’s current referralEarning value (which is typically zero) added to the tokenAmount, so the intended bonus is effectively based solely on the tokenAmount, but the logic does not deduct this bonus from any funds. This allows repeated abuse, meeting the goal of identifying a vulnerability in token flow manipulation. All prerequisites – controlling multiple accounts, having a minimal stake in the master account, and the referral bonus percentage being set to a nontrivial value – are realistic in many deployment scenarios.
