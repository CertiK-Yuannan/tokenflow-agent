For example, setting the monthly release percentage (releasePercentageFromDays) to a very high number for a deposit period of, say, 30 days means that when any deposit is made with a 30\u2010day staking period, the bonus calculated (depositAmount * releasePercentage / 1000) becomes disproportionately large. Consequently, when availableAmountForClaim is called after one or more 30-day periods, the claimable amount far exceeds the staked amount. This inflated bonus, possibly combined with excessive referral bonuses, allows the attacker to withdraw many more tokens than what was originally deposited, effectively draining the contract\u2019s token balance.",

After 30 days, the available amount is calculated as:\n   numberOfMonths = 1, and perMonthsMaturity = tokenAmount * 10000 / 1000 = tokenAmount * 10.\n   Thus, availableAmountForClaim becomes tokenAmount * 10 (or even more if multiple months accrue).\n\n4. The attacker calls:\n   withdrawTokensV3(attackerAddress);\n\nResult: The attacker withdraws a token amount several times higher than tokenAmount, thereby profiting from the artificially inflated bonus. This sequence can be executed repeatedly if the contract holds sufficient token liquidity.",
    "profit_mechanism": "By setting abnormally high bonus parameters, the bonus calculation in availableAmountForClaim multiplies the staked amount into a much larger value.

With values set arbitrarily high, the computed available withdrawal amount can be inflated to levels far exceeding the total tokens actually staked. As a result, when withdrawTokensV3 is called, the contract transfers an excessive number of tokens to the user, effectively enabling an attacker (or colluding admin) to drain the contract\u2019s token reserves.
