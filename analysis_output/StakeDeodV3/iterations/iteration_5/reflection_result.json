  "goal_met": true,
  "finding_quality": "high",
  "evaluation": "The vulnerability is legitimate. The admin-controlled functions setReleasePercentageV3 and setReferalPercentageFromDaysV3 allow the admin to arbitrarily set bonus parameters without any sanity checks or upper bounds. These parameters are stored in the depositInfo struct for each deposit and directly affect the per\u2010month bonus computation in availableAmountForClaim. By configuring these values to be extremely high (for example, setting the monthly bonus percentage to a value that multiplies the staked amount several times over), an attacker with admin privileges (or a colluding party) can cause the calculated claimable amount to far exceed the originally staked tokens. This would allow a withdrawal that drains the contract\u2019s token balance if sufficient liquidity is available.",
  "critical_flaws": "The functions that set bonus parameters (setReleasePercentageV3 and setReferalPercentageFromDaysV3) do not impose any upper limits or sanity checks, meaning that a malicious admin can inflate bonus values to arbitrary levels. This flaw directly leads to an exploitable error in the availableAmountForClaim calculation.",
  "overlooked_constraints": "The exploit requires control of the admin account or effective collusion with the admin, and the attack only becomes lucrative if the contract holds enough tokens to cover the inflated payout. However, these conditions are realistic in many systems where admin privileges exist and sufficient funds are deposited.",
  "variables_to_exclude": [
    "None of the variables should be excluded from analysis since the bonus parameters (releasePercentageFromDays and getReferalBonusFromDays) are directly used in the critical calculations. Even though they are admin-controlled, they are the source of the vulnerability."
  ],
  "additional_conditions": "For a successful exploitation, the attacker or colluding party must: (1) control the admin account or collude with an admin; (2) deposit tokens with a staking duration that matches the manipulated bonus parameter (e.g., 30 days); and (3) ensure that the contract's balance is sufficiently funded so that when the inflated withdrawal is triggered, the transfer succeeds.",
  "suggestions": "Further analysis should focus on implementing upper bounds and sanity checks on the bonus parameters. It may also be helpful to separate the roles of admin and contract owner to mitigate the risk of a rogue admin. Additionally, integrating time locks or multi-signature requirements for changes in critical parameters could reduce the potential for abuse.",
  "new_focus_areas": "In subsequent analyses, focus on the governance and role management aspects to prevent misuse of administrative functions, and examine the economic incentives for admins to set or abuse these parameters. Also, review the contract funding model to assess risks if the admin sets parameters that create payouts exceeding what is securely held.",
