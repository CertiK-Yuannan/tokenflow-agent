  "vulnerability_found": true,
  "vulnerability_type": "Admin-Controlled Parameter Manipulation / Bonus Inflation",
  "attack_scenario": "A malicious actor who controls the admin account can set arbitrary, extremely high values for the mappings releasePercentageFromDays and getReferalBonusFromDays via the functions setReleasePercentageV3 and setReferalPercentageFromDaysV3. For example, setting the monthly release percentage (releasePercentageFromDays) to a very high number for a deposit period of, say, 30 days means that when any deposit is made with a 30\u2010day staking period, the bonus calculated (depositAmount * releasePercentage / 1000) becomes disproportionately large. Consequently, when availableAmountForClaim is called after one or more 30-day periods, the claimable amount far exceeds the staked amount. This inflated bonus, possibly combined with excessive referral bonuses, allows the attacker to withdraw many more tokens than what was originally deposited, effectively draining the contract\u2019s token balance.",
  "exploit_code": "1. Admin calls:\n   setReleasePercentageV3(30, 10000);\n   setReferalPercentageFromDaysV3(30, 5000);\n\n2. An attacker (or a colluding user) stakes tokens:\n   stakeTokensV3(tokenAmount, someReferrer, 30);\n\n3. After 30 days, the available amount is calculated as:\n   numberOfMonths = 1, and perMonthsMaturity = tokenAmount * 10000 / 1000 = tokenAmount * 10.\n   Thus, availableAmountForClaim becomes tokenAmount * 10 (or even more if multiple months accrue).\n\n4. The attacker calls:\n   withdrawTokensV3(attackerAddress);\n\nResult: The attacker withdraws a token amount several times higher than tokenAmount, thereby profiting from the artificially inflated bonus. This sequence can be executed repeatedly if the contract holds sufficient token liquidity.",
  "profit_mechanism": "By setting abnormally high bonus parameters, the bonus calculation in availableAmountForClaim multiplies the staked amount into a much larger value. When the attacker withdraws, the contract transfers a sum that far exceeds the deposit, effectively minting an economic deficit in the contract. The attacker profits by receiving extra tokens not justified by the original stake.",
  "attack_prerequisites": "\u2022 Control of the admin account (or collusion with the admin).\n\u2022 No upper limit checks on the bonus parameters in setReleasePercentageV3 and setReferalPercentageFromDaysV3.\n\u2022 Sufficient token balance in the contract to cover the inflated withdrawals.\n\u2022 The attacker may need to wait until the minimum staking period (e.g., 30 days) has passed for the bonus calculation to trigger.",
  "attack_limitations": "\u2022 The exploit requires the attacker or their accomplice to have admin privileges. Without control of the admin role, these parameters cannot be arbitrarily manipulated.\n\u2022 The bonus is accrued based on elapsed time, so the attacker must wait for the staking period to pass. However, the waiting time is negligible compared to the profit potential if the bonus parameters are set extremely high.\n\u2022 Governance checks or external audits may flag extreme parameter settings, potentially mitigating abuse if proper admin accountability mechanisms exist.",
  "confidence": "high",
  "reasoning": "The contract grants the admin unrestricted power to modify bonus parameters through setReleasePercentageV3 and setReferalPercentageFromDaysV3 without any sanity checks or upper limits. In stakeTokensV3, these parameters are recorded in depositInfo and directly drive the per-month bonus computation in availableAmountForClaim. With values set arbitrarily high, the computed available withdrawal amount can be inflated to levels far exceeding the total tokens actually staked. As a result, when withdrawTokensV3 is called, the contract transfers an excessive number of tokens to the user, effectively enabling an attacker (or colluding admin) to drain the contract\u2019s token reserves. Each step of the token flow\u2014from deposit to bonus calculation and withdrawal\u2014confirms that manipulation of the admin-controlled mappings directly leads to an exploitable flaw in the token flow.",
  "analysis_metadata": {
    "iteration": 4,
    "analysis_focus": "The focus should be on the admin-controlled bonus parameters: releasePercentageFromDays and getReferalBonusFromDays. In addition, the calculation dependencies in availableAmountForClaim are critical\u2014specifically the variables depositInfo[x].depositAmount, depositInfo[x].depositedTimestamp, and the resulting monthly bonus computation based on the (block.timestamp - depositInfo[x].depositedTimestamp) divided by 30 days.",
    "manipulation_strategy": "An attacker with admin privileges (or colluding with the admin) can call setReleasePercentageV3 and setReferalPercentageFromDaysV3 with extremely high percentages for a chosen _days value. This would cause every new deposit made with that duration to compute a disproportionately high per-month bonus (depositAmount * huge monthlyPercentage / 1000) and referral bonus. When the user later calls availableAmountForClaim, the contract will calculate an excessive available amount (potentially far exceeding the original staked amount) allowing the attacker to withdraw far more tokens than the user staked, thus draining the contract\u2019s balance. Additionally, the manipulation of the deposit timestamp slightly (via miner influence) could further nudge the month count calculation within the availableAmountForClaim loop."
