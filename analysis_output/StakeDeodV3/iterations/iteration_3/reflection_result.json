  "evaluation": "The analysis is correct that the admin-controlled mappings (releasePercentageFromDays and getReferalBonusFromDays) can be manipulated without any sanity bounds. With these parameters, the calculations in availableAmountForClaim are directly influenced, meaning that if the admin (or a compromised admin) sets absurdly high percentage values, an attacker depositing via stakeTokensV3 using the corresponding _days value can later withdraw an amount that far exceeds the initial deposit. This vulnerability is real in the context of privilege misuse\u2014if the admin role is compromised or misused, the attacker can drain funds from the contract. However, it is not an external vulnerability in that an unprivileged attacker cannot change these parameters without admin access.",
  "critical_flaws": "The attack scenario critically depends on having access to the admin privileges. In a correctly managed system with a secure admin account (or additional governance/multisig measures), an external attacker cannot modify these parameters. Thus, while the vulnerability is legitimate, its exploitability is limited by the assumption that the admin role is secure. Additionally, the contract\u2019s token balance could limit withdrawals if there aren\u2019t enough tokens in the contract.",
  "overlooked_constraints": "The finding does not fully consider that the parameters are only admin-configurable. If the admin follows best practices and is secure (or if a timelock/multisig is implemented), the risk is mitigated. Moreover, the exploit requires that the contract have a sufficient token balance to satisfy an inflated withdrawal request.",
  "variables_to_exclude": [
    "For future analysis, the admin-controlled parameters releasePercentageFromDays and getReferalBonusFromDays should be flagged as dependent on the secure management of the admin account. Their potential manipulation should be considered only in scenarios where admin compromise or misconfiguration is a realistic threat."
  ],
  "additional_conditions": "A successful attack requires that the attacker either controls the admin account or colludes with the admin, that the manipulated percentages are set extremely high, and that there are sufficient tokens in the contract to cover the inflated withdrawal amounts.",
  "suggestions": "It is advisable to impose sanity bounds or hard limits on these percentage values to prevent unreasonable configurations. Additionally, reconsider the admin design\u2014implementing additional controls such as multi-signature authorization or timelocks for altering critical parameters would mitigate the risk of malicious or accidental misuse.",
  "new_focus_areas": "Future audits should focus on examining the overall admin role management, secure parameter initialization, and governance frameworks. It is also worthwhile to analyze if similar admin-controlled parameters are used elsewhere and whether these should be subject to on-chain validation constraints or multisig approvals.",
