  "evaluation": "The audit finding appears to be correct and rigorous. The review shows that all critical state variables are updated before external calls where possible, and that the use of SafeERC20 functions effectively mitigates potential reentrancy risks (assuming that the underlying ERC20 token is standard and non\u2010malicious). The stakeTokensV3 function creates the deposit record before the token transfer, and the bonus/reward calculations are based on admin\u2010controlled percentage mappings. The withdrawal function correctly calculates the available claimable amount based on the deposit\u2019s accrued bonus and subtracts any previously withdrawn value. Although the state update in withdrawTokensV3 happens after the external safeTransfer call, under the assumption that the token contract behaves according to standard ERC20 practices (i.e. does not trigger reentrancy), this ordering does not create a viable attack vector. Therefore, no exploitable logic flaw was detected that would allow an attacker to profit by manipulating token flow.",
  "critical_flaws": "None identified \u2013 the deposit, bonus, and withdrawal logic, as well as the admin-controlled parameters, provide sufficient safeguards under the stated operational assumptions.",
  "overlooked_constraints": "The analysis assumes that the token contract is a standard ERC20 implementation without non-standard callbacks (for example, EIP-777 hooks). Additionally, admin-controlled parameters and the use of SafeERC20 functions are assumed to be implemented correctly. These constraints were properly considered.",
