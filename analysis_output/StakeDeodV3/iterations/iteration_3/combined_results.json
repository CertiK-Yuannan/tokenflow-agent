In availableAmountForClaim the contract loops over userDepositIds to read depositInfo[x] values \u2013 particularly depositAmount, depositedTimestamp, timePeriodInDays, and monthlyPercentage (set via the admin-controlled releasePercentageFromDays mapping). In parallel, stakeTokensV3 is the entry point for a deposit, where both monthlyPercentage and referral bonus percentages (from getReferalBonusFromDays) are set based on the _days parameter provided by the user but controlled ultimately through admin-set mappings via setReleasePercentageV3 and setReferalPercentageFromDaysV3. These admin functions feed into the deposit creation and later the withdrawal calculation.",

The strategy involves depositing tokens through stakeTokensV3 with a chosen _days value corresponding to those extreme percentages, and then calling withdrawTokensV3 to claim an inflated token amount. Since the deposit calculation depends on values easily set by the admin, manipulating these dependencies can cause an abnormal token flow.",
    "expected_impact": "If the manipulated bonus percentages are set extremely high, the computed available claimable token amount will far exceed the intended stake and bonus. This could potentially drain the contract\u2019s token balance when a user (or colluding admin) withdraws, effectively bypassing the normal token vesting logic and transferring a disproportionate amount of tokens out of the pool.",
    "assumptions": "This analysis assumes that the admin role is misconfigured or compromised such that extremely high bonus percentages are incorrectly set.

    "attack_scenario": "An attacker who is either the admin or has colluded with the admin can manipulate the bonus percentage settings. The two admin functions, setReleasePercentageV3 and setReferalPercentageFromDaysV3, allow the admin to set arbitrary percentages for the monthly token release (monthlyPercentage) and the referral bonus. If an attacker (or a colluding admin) sets these percentages to an extremely high value for a given _days parameter, then when a user (or the attacker themself) makes a deposit with that _days value via stakeTokensV3, the deposit record will include the inflated bonus percentages. Later, when availableAmountForClaim is computed inside withdrawTokensV3, the calculation uses the manipulated monthlyPercentage (and referral bonus) to compute an available claimable amount that is vastly higher than the original deposit. In effect, the attacker can deposit a small amount and, after waiting the minimal required period (or exploiting the referral bonus immediately), withdraw a multiple of the deposited tokens\u2014draining tokens held in the contract.",

    "profit_mechanism": "By artificially inflating the monthly release and referral bonus percentages, the withdrawal calculation in availableAmountForClaim returns an available balance that is many times the deposited amount. When the attacker calls withdrawTokensV3, the contract uses safeTransfer to send out this huge amount of tokens. The profit comes from the fact that the contract holds tokens from many users or an initial pool, and the manipulated bonus formula allows the attacker to drain these tokens in excess of the deposit amount.",
    "attack_prerequisites": "\u2022 The attacker must have control over the admin account or be able to coerce the current admin into setting extreme bonus percentages.\n\u2022 There must be no bounds or sanity checks on the values passed to setReleasePercentageV3 and setReferalPercentageFromDaysV3.\n\u2022 The attacker must ensure that the chosen _days value in their deposit corresponds to the manipulated bonus parameters.\n\u2022 The attacker may have to wait at least one full period (e.g., 30 days) for the bonus to become claimable based on block.timestamp.",
    "attack_limitations": "\u2022 If the admin role is secure and not compromised, an external attacker cannot directly modify these bonus parameters.\n\u2022 The attacker must wait for the time period to pass to accumulate bonus rewards (unless they manipulate referral bonuses immediately).\n\u2022 The overall impact is limited by the contract's token balance; if the contract does not hold enough tokens, the withdrawal may fail.",
    "confidence": "high",
    "reasoning": "The calculations in availableAmountForClaim loop over each deposit and use the monthlyPercentage (derived from the admin-controlled mapping releasePercentageFromDays) to calculate a per\u2010month bonus. There are no upper bounds or sanity checks on this percentage. Similarly, the referral bonus percentage is set via an admin-controlled mapping with no restrictions. By setting these values to extreme numbers, the withdrawal formula ends up returning a claimable amount that far exceeds the original deposit amount. Since these sensitive parameters are solely in the hands of the admin, if that role is compromised or abused, a malicious admin can orchestrate a scenario where depleting the contract's tokens through withdrawals becomes trivial. The provided transaction sequence illustrates how an attacker can deposit a small amount and later withdraw an exaggerated amount by exploiting the manipulated bonus percentages.",

With these parameters, the calculations in availableAmountForClaim are directly influenced, meaning that if the admin (or a compromised admin) sets absurdly high percentage values, an attacker depositing via stakeTokensV3 using the corresponding _days value can later withdraw an amount that far exceeds the initial deposit. This vulnerability is real in the context of privilege misuse\u2014if the admin role is compromised or misused, the attacker can drain funds from the contract.

Thus, while the code logic is vulnerable to bonus parameter manipulation due to an unbounded _days input, the actual risk depends on proper administrative practices.",
