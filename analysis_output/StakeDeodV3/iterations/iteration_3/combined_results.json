It shows how a user\u2019s staking action (via stakeTokensV3) uses the deposited amount and time period (which later affect the withdrawal calculation) and how referral earnings (users[_userAddress].referalEarning) are updated. It also shows, in a simplified loop, how the withdrawal function uses safeTransfer to move tokens out of the contract. Note that safeTransferFrom and safeTransfer (from the IERC20 interface via SafeERC20 library) are used to move tokens into and out of the contract.

When a user calls stakeTokensV3, the deposit record is created with depositAmount and timePeriodInDays directly provided by the user. This forms the basis of future bonus accrual and withdrawal calculations.\n\n2. The referral bonus is computed and added (either directly to users[referrer].referalEarning or via addReferalEarning) which increases the eventual claimable token amount.\n\n3. The safeTransferFrom dependency ensures that tokens are securely moved from the user into the contract, thereby \u201clocking\u201d the stake.\n\n4. When withdrawing via withdrawTokensV3, the contract iterates over each deposit. It uses depositAmount and timePeriodInDays (to compute maturity months) along with the monthly percentage to calculate available tokens. Finally, safeTransfer is used to send tokens out of the contract, ensuring proper token flow.\n\nThis pseudo-code outlines the main normal execution path and illustrates how the specified variables and dependencies interact in the token flow.",

    "reasons_if_not_feasible": "After a detailed review of the pseudo\u2010code, no flaw was found that would allow an attacker to increase the token flow in their favor. The staking and withdrawal logic use deposit information provided by the user in a manner that is later validated by time\u2010based accrual calculations. In addition, the use of SafeERC20 methods (safeTransferFrom and safeTransfer) protects against reentrancy attacks given the assumption that these token methods are not externally manipulable. Although the deposit record is created before calling safeTransferFrom, a failure in token transfer would revert the entire transaction, preventing any inconsistency. Referral bonuses are calculated based on admin\u2010defined mappings and incorporate an external validity check. In all cases the computations and state updates (including tracking of withdrawn amounts) occur in a way that precludes an exploitable gap.  ",
    "reasoning": "1. In stakeTokensV3 the deposit record is created using the user\u2010supplied amount and stakeDays. Although these values determine future bonus calculations, the admin controls the percentage mappings (releasePercentageFromDays and getReferalBonusFromDays) so that excessive bonuses cannot be acquired unless the admin misconfigures them.\n2. The referral earnings update is subject to an external validation (referrerIsValid) to ensure that self-referral is not allowed and that only valid referrers benefit.\n3. Tokens are transferred using safeTransferFrom, and any failure (or potential issues in nonstandard tokens) would revert the transaction, so no deposit record is left orphaned.\n4. In withdrawTokensV3, the bonus accrual is computed on\u2010the\u2010fly based on elapsed time and prior withdrawal data (using the withdrawnAmount mapping). This cumulative calculation ensures that even multiple withdrawals will only provide what has actually accrued from the deposit and referral earnings.\n5. The safeTransfer dependency (used to pay out tokens) is assumed to be secure and non\u2010manipulable since it does not rely on the low-level .call method, so reentrancy or similar vulnerabilities are not applicable per the analysis assumptions.\n6. Although the state update for withdrawnAmount occurs after safeTransfer, given that the external token call is via a safeIERC20 library function and the assumption that external dependencies are secure, the order of operations does not introduce an exploitable reentrancy risk.\n\nBased on these points and under the stated assumptions, all inputs, state updates, and external calls occur in a controlled fashion making an exploit for profit infeasible.",

    "evaluation": "The audit finding appears to be correct and rigorous. The review shows that all critical state variables are updated before external calls where possible, and that the use of SafeERC20 functions effectively mitigates potential reentrancy risks (assuming that the underlying ERC20 token is standard and non\u2010malicious). The stakeTokensV3 function creates the deposit record before the token transfer, and the bonus/reward calculations are based on admin\u2010controlled percentage mappings. The withdrawal function correctly calculates the available claimable amount based on the deposit\u2019s accrued bonus and subtracts any previously withdrawn value. Although the state update in withdrawTokensV3 happens after the external safeTransfer call, under the assumption that the token contract behaves according to standard ERC20 practices (i.e. does not trigger reentrancy), this ordering does not create a viable attack vector. Therefore, no exploitable logic flaw was detected that would allow an attacker to profit by manipulating token flow.",
