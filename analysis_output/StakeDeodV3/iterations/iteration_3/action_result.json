  "reasons_if_not_feasible": "After a detailed review of the pseudo\u2010code, no flaw was found that would allow an attacker to increase the token flow in their favor. The staking and withdrawal logic use deposit information provided by the user in a manner that is later validated by time\u2010based accrual calculations. In addition, the use of SafeERC20 methods (safeTransferFrom and safeTransfer) protects against reentrancy attacks given the assumption that these token methods are not externally manipulable. Although the deposit record is created before calling safeTransferFrom, a failure in token transfer would revert the entire transaction, preventing any inconsistency. Referral bonuses are calculated based on admin\u2010defined mappings and incorporate an external validity check. In all cases the computations and state updates (including tracking of withdrawn amounts) occur in a way that precludes an exploitable gap.  ",
  "reasoning": "1. In stakeTokensV3 the deposit record is created using the user\u2010supplied amount and stakeDays. Although these values determine future bonus calculations, the admin controls the percentage mappings (releasePercentageFromDays and getReferalBonusFromDays) so that excessive bonuses cannot be acquired unless the admin misconfigures them.\n2. The referral earnings update is subject to an external validation (referrerIsValid) to ensure that self-referral is not allowed and that only valid referrers benefit.\n3. Tokens are transferred using safeTransferFrom, and any failure (or potential issues in nonstandard tokens) would revert the transaction, so no deposit record is left orphaned.\n4. In withdrawTokensV3, the bonus accrual is computed on\u2010the\u2010fly based on elapsed time and prior withdrawal data (using the withdrawnAmount mapping). This cumulative calculation ensures that even multiple withdrawals will only provide what has actually accrued from the deposit and referral earnings.\n5. The safeTransfer dependency (used to pay out tokens) is assumed to be secure and non\u2010manipulable since it does not rely on the low-level .call method, so reentrancy or similar vulnerabilities are not applicable per the analysis assumptions.\n6. Although the state update for withdrawnAmount occurs after safeTransfer, given that the external token call is via a safeIERC20 library function and the assumption that external dependencies are secure, the order of operations does not introduce an exploitable reentrancy risk.\n\nBased on these points and under the stated assumptions, all inputs, state updates, and external calls occur in a controlled fashion making an exploit for profit infeasible.",
