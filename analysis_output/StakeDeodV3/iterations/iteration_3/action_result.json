  "vulnerability_type": "Privilege Misuse / Misconfiguration of Admin\u2010Controlled Parameters",
  "attack_scenario": "An attacker who is either the admin or has colluded with the admin can manipulate the bonus percentage settings. The two admin functions, setReleasePercentageV3 and setReferalPercentageFromDaysV3, allow the admin to set arbitrary percentages for the monthly token release (monthlyPercentage) and the referral bonus. If an attacker (or a colluding admin) sets these percentages to an extremely high value for a given _days parameter, then when a user (or the attacker themself) makes a deposit with that _days value via stakeTokensV3, the deposit record will include the inflated bonus percentages. Later, when availableAmountForClaim is computed inside withdrawTokensV3, the calculation uses the manipulated monthlyPercentage (and referral bonus) to compute an available claimable amount that is vastly higher than the original deposit. In effect, the attacker can deposit a small amount and, after waiting the minimal required period (or exploiting the referral bonus immediately), withdraw a multiple of the deposited tokens\u2014draining tokens held in the contract.",
  "exploit_code": "/* Example exploit transaction sequence by the admin/attacker */\n\n// Step 1: The attacker sets an extraordinarily high bonus percentage\nstakeDeodV3.setReleasePercentageV3(30, 1000000);   // 1,000,000/1000 = 1000x monthly bonus\nstakeDeodV3.setReferalPercentageFromDaysV3(30, 1000000); // similarly extreme referral bonus\n\n// Step 2: The attacker (or an accomplice) stakes a minimal amount using the compromised _days value\n// (Assume the attacker deposits 100 tokens and uses their own address as the referrer to capture referral bonus)\nstakeDeodV3.stakeTokensV3(100 * 10**decimals, attackerAddress, 30);\n\n// Step 3: After at least 30 days, the attacker calls the withdraw function\n// The availableAmountForClaim calculation will use:\n//   numberOfMonths = 1 (or more, depending on the block.timestamp)\n//   perMonthsMaturity = (100 tokens * 1000000) / 1000 = 100000 tokens\n// Thus, available balance = 1 * 100000 tokens, plus the original 100 tokens stake (if maturity reached).\n// Step 4: The attacker calls:\nstakeDeodV3.withdrawTokensV3(attackerAddress);\n\n// The contract then transfers a massive amount (far exceeding the 100 tokens originally deposited) to the attacker.",
  "profit_mechanism": "By artificially inflating the monthly release and referral bonus percentages, the withdrawal calculation in availableAmountForClaim returns an available balance that is many times the deposited amount. When the attacker calls withdrawTokensV3, the contract uses safeTransfer to send out this huge amount of tokens. The profit comes from the fact that the contract holds tokens from many users or an initial pool, and the manipulated bonus formula allows the attacker to drain these tokens in excess of the deposit amount.",
  "attack_prerequisites": "\u2022 The attacker must have control over the admin account or be able to coerce the current admin into setting extreme bonus percentages.\n\u2022 There must be no bounds or sanity checks on the values passed to setReleasePercentageV3 and setReferalPercentageFromDaysV3.\n\u2022 The attacker must ensure that the chosen _days value in their deposit corresponds to the manipulated bonus parameters.\n\u2022 The attacker may have to wait at least one full period (e.g., 30 days) for the bonus to become claimable based on block.timestamp.",
  "attack_limitations": "\u2022 If the admin role is secure and not compromised, an external attacker cannot directly modify these bonus parameters.\n\u2022 The attacker must wait for the time period to pass to accumulate bonus rewards (unless they manipulate referral bonuses immediately).\n\u2022 The overall impact is limited by the contract's token balance; if the contract does not hold enough tokens, the withdrawal may fail.",
  "confidence": "high",
  "reasoning": "The calculations in availableAmountForClaim loop over each deposit and use the monthlyPercentage (derived from the admin-controlled mapping releasePercentageFromDays) to calculate a per\u2010month bonus. There are no upper bounds or sanity checks on this percentage. Similarly, the referral bonus percentage is set via an admin-controlled mapping with no restrictions. By setting these values to extreme numbers, the withdrawal formula ends up returning a claimable amount that far exceeds the original deposit amount. Since these sensitive parameters are solely in the hands of the admin, if that role is compromised or abused, a malicious admin can orchestrate a scenario where depleting the contract's tokens through withdrawals becomes trivial. The provided transaction sequence illustrates how an attacker can deposit a small amount and later withdraw an exaggerated amount by exploiting the manipulated bonus percentages.",
  "analysis_metadata": {
    "iteration": 2,
    "analysis_focus": "Focus on the variables that affect the withdrawal calculation: depositInfo[x].depositAmount, depositInfo[x].timePeriodInDays, and especially depositInfo[x].monthlyPercentage (and indirectly getReferalBonusFromDays) which are determined by the admin-controlled mappings. Also focus on the dependencies on block.timestamp and the calculation loop in availableAmountForClaim, as well as the withdrawal update through withdrawnAmount mapping.",
    "manipulation_strategy": "An attacker could try to manipulate the parameters by exploiting the admin functions (setReleasePercentageV3 and setReferalPercentageFromDaysV3). If the admin misconfigures or maliciously configures extreme bonus percentages (i.e. an unreasonably high monthlyPercentage via releasePercentageFromDays or referral bonus via getReferalBonusFromDays), then each staked deposit will immediately (or over a short period) generate a very high available balance. The strategy involves depositing tokens through stakeTokensV3 with a chosen _days value corresponding to those extreme percentages, and then calling withdrawTokensV3 to claim an inflated token amount. Since the deposit calculation depends on values easily set by the admin, manipulating these dependencies can cause an abnormal token flow."
