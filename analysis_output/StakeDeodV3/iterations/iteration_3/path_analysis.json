  "code_path": "The primary flow starts in withdrawTokensV3, which calls availableAmountForClaim. In availableAmountForClaim the contract loops over userDepositIds to read depositInfo[x] values \u2013 particularly depositAmount, depositedTimestamp, timePeriodInDays, and monthlyPercentage (set via the admin-controlled releasePercentageFromDays mapping). In parallel, stakeTokensV3 is the entry point for a deposit, where both monthlyPercentage and referral bonus percentages (from getReferalBonusFromDays) are set based on the _days parameter provided by the user but controlled ultimately through admin-set mappings via setReleasePercentageV3 and setReferalPercentageFromDaysV3. These admin functions feed into the deposit creation and later the withdrawal calculation.",
  "analysis_focus": "Focus on the variables that affect the withdrawal calculation: depositInfo[x].depositAmount, depositInfo[x].timePeriodInDays, and especially depositInfo[x].monthlyPercentage (and indirectly getReferalBonusFromDays) which are determined by the admin-controlled mappings. Also focus on the dependencies on block.timestamp and the calculation loop in availableAmountForClaim, as well as the withdrawal update through withdrawnAmount mapping.",
  "manipulation_strategy": "An attacker could try to manipulate the parameters by exploiting the admin functions (setReleasePercentageV3 and setReferalPercentageFromDaysV3). If the admin misconfigures or maliciously configures extreme bonus percentages (i.e. an unreasonably high monthlyPercentage via releasePercentageFromDays or referral bonus via getReferalBonusFromDays), then each staked deposit will immediately (or over a short period) generate a very high available balance. The strategy involves depositing tokens through stakeTokensV3 with a chosen _days value corresponding to those extreme percentages, and then calling withdrawTokensV3 to claim an inflated token amount. Since the deposit calculation depends on values easily set by the admin, manipulating these dependencies can cause an abnormal token flow.",
  "expected_impact": "If the manipulated bonus percentages are set extremely high, the computed available claimable token amount will far exceed the intended stake and bonus. This could potentially drain the contract\u2019s token balance when a user (or colluding admin) withdraws, effectively bypassing the normal token vesting logic and transferring a disproportionate amount of tokens out of the pool.",
  "assumptions": "This analysis assumes that the admin role is misconfigured or compromised such that extremely high bonus percentages are incorrectly set. It also assumes that there are no upper bound checks on the values for monthlyPercentage and referral bonuses in the admin functions, allowing an attacker (or malicious admin) to exploit these settings.",
