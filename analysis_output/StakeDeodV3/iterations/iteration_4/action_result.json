  "vulnerability_found": true,
  "vulnerability_type": "Unbacked Referral Bonus / Inflation Vulnerability",
  "attack_scenario": "An attacker who controls two addresses can abuse the referral bonus mechanism. In stakeTokensV3 the bonus for a valid referrer is credited directly to the referrer\u2019s account (either in users[...] or stakeReferal mapping) and later added in availableAmountForClaim during withdrawal. The bonus is computed purely as a fraction of the staked amount of the referred deposit and is not \u2018backed\u2019 by any separate deposit. By carefully using one address (Account A) as a referrer and another (Account B) to perform a substantial deposit with Account A named as referrer, the attacker can eventually withdraw more tokens than originally deposited. In effect, Account B locks tokens in the contract while Account A (which only ever did a minimal self\u2010stake to be \u201cvalid\u201d) can withdraw the referral bonus\u2014thus \u201ccreating\u201d extra token flow in a coordinated sequence.",
  "exploit_code": "Step 1 (Prepare referrer):\n  \u2022 Using account A (the planned referrer), perform a minimal stake (for example, deposit 1 token with any valid stakingDays) so that userStakedStatus[A] becomes TRUE.\n\nStep 2 (Exploit referral bonus):\n  \u2022 From account B (the attacker\u2019s second account), call stakeTokensV3 with parameters:\n      tokenAmount = X (a relatively large amount, say 100 tokens),\n      referrer = account A,\n      stakingDays = D (choose D such that getReferalBonusFromDays[D] is nonzero, possibly a value that is allowed by the admin\u2019s configuration).\n  \u2022 Because account A is now already a staker and caller B is not equal to account A, the code branches into the first condition, and the referral bonus is computed as:\n       bonus = (X * getReferalBonusFromDays[D]) / 1000\n     and added to users[A].referalEarning.\n\nStep 3 (Withdrawal by referrer):\n  \u2022 After waiting any necessary short period (or even immediately if the bonus does not depend on elapsed time) account A invokes withdrawTokensV3, which calls availableAmountForClaim(A) and returns the bonus amount in addition to any minor amount from its own (minimal) deposit record.\n\nStep 4 (Profit):\n  \u2022 Because account A\u2019s deposit was negligible, the withdrawal amount from account A is mostly the bonus generated by account B\u2019s deposit. The tokens withdrawn come from the contract\u2019s balance \u2013 which only consists of tokens deposited by stakers \u2013 so the attacker effectively extracts extra tokens that were never truly \u2018backed\u2019 by a matching deposit from account A.",
  "profit_mechanism": "The referral bonus is computed as a percentage of a staker\u2019s deposit and credited separately to the referrer\u2019s record. By using two colluding accounts, the attacker makes account B deposit a relatively large amount while receipt of the bonus by account A (which did a trivial stake merely to qualify) allows them to later withdraw the bonus \u2013 thereby withdrawing more tokens from the contract than were deposited overall. The attacker, controlling both sides, is able to reassemble these funds to end up with both the bonus and, eventually, both staked amounts, effectively profiting extra tokens out of the token flow.",
  "attack_prerequisites": "\u2022 Attacker must control two addresses, one that can be registered as a staker (Account A) and one that will deposit a significant token amount (Account B).\n\u2022 The referral bonus mapping (getReferalBonusFromDays) must be set to yield a nonzero bonus for the chosen stakingDays value. This may depend on admin configuration, but if the bonus percentage is nontrivial then the attack is profitable.\n\u2022 The external check (checkUserStakedStatus) must return a positive status for the referrer (which is ensured by staking a minimal amount from Account A beforehand).",
  "attack_limitations": "\u2022 The attack assumes that the admin\u2010defined bonus percentages (both for monthly bonus and referral bonus) are not capped or controlled so that the referral bonus becomes significant relative to the deposit amount. If these values are set very low then the profit may be neglible.\n\u2022 If there are any off-chain or on-chain limits (for example, restrictions on the range of valid stakingDays) those could limit the ability to choose an optimal staking period for maximum bonus.\n\u2022 The contract funds come solely from tokens deposited by stakers. If many users stake legitimately, there may be other withdrawal claims that compete, possibly reducing available balance. However, in an isolated attack scenario the attacker can control the relative amounts.",
  "edge_cases": "\u2022 If stakingDays is forced to be one of a few allowed values (set by admin) then the attacker may not be able to choose a value that maximizes bonus extraction.\n\u2022 If the admin sets the referral bonus percentages to zero or extremely low values, the incentive to perform the referral attack is reduced.\n\u2022 If additional state updates were later added to mark deposits as \u2018claimed\u2019 (which are not present in the pseudo\u2010code) it would likely prevent repeated withdrawals of the bonus.\n\u2022 The external dependency for token transfer (IERC20.safeTransfer) is assumed not to be reentrant. If it were upgraded or replaced with one that allowed reentrancy, further exploits might be possible but are outside the current scope.",
  "confidence": "high",
  "reasons_if_not_feasible": "",
  "reasoning": "The attack stems from the fact that the contract separately credits referral bonuses based solely on the deposit value provided by any staker who names a valid referrer. Since referral earnings are stored in either users[referrer].referalEarning or stakeReferal[referrer] and then added (without considering any \u2018backing\u2019 by a separate deposit) when computing the total available withdrawal amount, an attacker controlling both the referrer and the staker accounts can induce a non\u2010backed bonus. The sequence is feasible because (1) the staker\u2019s deposit is accepted and recorded before token transfer (but the token transfer itself is done with safe functions that do not permit reentrancy, per our assumptions), (2) the referral bonus calculation uses a user-controlled stakingDays (subject to admin mapping) and deposit token amount, and (3) the withdrawal simply subtracts the total withdrawn amount from a sum that includes the bonus, allowing the bonus to be \u201ccashed out\u201d once. In a real exploit the attacker deposits a small amount from the referrer (just enough to qualify) and a large amount from the staker, thereby extracting a healthy referral bonus that is effectively extra tokens from the contract.",
