  "vulnerability_found": true,
  "vulnerability_type": "Admin-controlled parameter manipulation",
  "attack_scenario": "An attacker with admin privileges (or an admin colluding with an attacker) can call setReleasePercentageV3 and setReferalPercentageFromDaysV3 with arbitrarily high values. For example, the attacker sets the monthly bonus parameter (releasePercentageFromDays) for a given staking period (_days) to an extremely high number (e.g. 100000, representing a 10,000% monthly bonus, relative to the fixed divider of 1000). Then when the attacker (or a colluding user) stakes tokens through stakeTokensV3, the deposit\u2019s monthlyPercentage field is recorded with this huge bonus. When availableAmountForClaim is calculated, the multiplier (the number of full 30\u2011day periods multiplied by an inflated per\u2011month bonus) results in an available balance that far exceeds the original deposit. Finally, the attacker can call withdrawTokensV3 to transfer out an overinflated token amount from the contract.",
  "exploit_code": "/*\n   Transaction Sequence Example:\n   1. Admin sets an exorbitant monthly release percentage for a chosen staking duration.\n      E.g. setReleasePercentageV3(90, 100000);  // For 90-day stakes, the monthly bonus is set to 100000/1000 = 100x of deposit\n   2. Admin (or colluding attacker) sets an arbitrarily high referal bonus if desired:\n      E.g. setReferalPercentageFromDaysV3(90, 50000);\n   3. The attacker then stakes tokens:\n      stakeTokensV3(1000, attacker_address, 90);\n         // A deposit is recorded with depositAmount = 1000 and monthlyPercentage = 100000 (from mapping)\n   4. After at least one 30\u2011day period passes (ensuring numberOfMonths>=1), the attacker calls:\n      withdrawTokensV3(attacker_address);\n         // availableAmountForClaim calculates: available = months * (depositAmount * bonus / 1000)\n         // e.g., for 1 month: available = 1 * (1000 * 100000/1000) = 100000 tokens\n   5. The attacker receives a withdrawal of tokens far exceeding the deposit.\n*/",
  "profit_mechanism": "By inflating the bonus percentages, the computed available withdrawal amount (based on the per\u2011month bonus multiplied by the number of elapsed 30\u2011day periods) becomes extremely high relative to the staked deposit. This means that even a small initial deposit can yield a withdrawal amount several orders of magnitude higher than what was deposited, allowing the attacker to drain the token balance held by the staking contract.",
  "attack_prerequisites": "The attacker must have admin privileges (or collude with the admin) so that they can set the bonus parameters with no bounds. The contract must hold enough tokens to cover the inflated withdrawal amounts. The staking deposit must be made after these inflated parameters are in place, and sufficient time (multiples of 30 days) must pass to trigger the bonus calculations.",
  "attack_limitations": "This attack is only feasible if the attacker is either the admin or is colluding with the admin. If admin keys are safely secured or if additional upper bound checks are added on bonus parameters, the exploit may be prevented. Additionally, if the contract\u2019s token balance is limited, the maximum payout may be capped by available funds even if the withdrawal computation overflows the expected yield.",
  "confidence": "high",
  "reasoning": "The code directly uses admin-controlled mappings to set the monthly bonus (releasePercentageFromDays) and referral bonus (getReferalBonusFromDays) without any bounds or sanity checks. When a user stakes tokens, these raw values are stored as part of the deposit info and later used in the availableAmountForClaim function. Because the calculation multiplies the deposit amount by the bonus percentage (divided by a constant 1000) and by the number of full 30\u2011day periods that have elapsed, any extreme value inserted by the admin immediately scales up the claimable payout. The lack of restrictions means an attacker with admin access can manipulate these bonus multipliers to cause withdrawals that far exceed the actual tokens staked, thereby profiting significantly from the vulnerability.",
  "analysis_metadata": {
    "iteration": 3,
    "analysis_focus": "Focus on the admin-controlled variables: releasePercentageFromDays[_days] and getReferalBonusFromDays[_days] (which are copied into each deposit\u2019s monthlyPercentage and referralPercentage when staking) as well as the depositInfo[x].depositAmount and depositInfo[x].depositedTimestamp. These values determine how much is claimable for each deposit since the logic calculates elapsed full '30\u2011day' periods. Also consider the referral earnings state variables (users[_userAddress].referalEarning and stakeReferal[_userAddress]) as they add to the overall claimable balance.",
    "manipulation_strategy": "An attacker (or a colluding admin) could manipulate the bonus percentages by calling setReleasePercentageV3 and setReferalPercentageFromDaysV3 with extremely high values for a given _days key. When an attacker then stakes tokens via stakeTokensV3, the deposit entry will record these manipulated bonus percentages, leading to an exaggerated per-month release bonus. Consequently, in availableAmountForClaim the multiplication of the staked deposit amount by the inflated bonus percentage will yield a withdrawal amount far exceeding a normal proportion of the deposit. Referral bonus fields can similarly be manipulated by influencing getReferalBonusFromDays. This, compounded with the deposit amount and timestamp-based maturity calculation, leads to withdrawal amounts that may drain tokens from the contract."
