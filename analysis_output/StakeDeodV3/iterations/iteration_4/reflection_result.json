  "evaluation": "The audit finding is legitimate. The code allows an admin to call setReleasePercentageV3 and setReferalPercentageFromDaysV3 with arbitrarily high values, and these values are then used directly in the bonus calculation in stakeTokensV3 and availableAmountForClaim. This lack of bounds or sanity checks means that if an attacker controls (or colludes with) the admin, they can set the monthly bonus (releasePercentageFromDays) to an exaggerated value. When a staking operation is performed, the deposit record will store these inflated bonus values, which in turn magnify the computed claimable amount (depositAmount * bonus / 1000 multiplied by elapsed 30\u2010day periods). The attack scenario described \u2013 staking a normal deposit and then withdrawing a massively inflated amount \u2013 accurately reflects how the vulnerability can be exploited.",
  "critical_flaws": "The critical flaw is the absence of validation or upper bounds on admin-set bonus parameters. Since these mappings are entirely under admin control, an attacker with admin privileges (or colluding with one) can exploit the calculations in availableAmountForClaim to drain the contract's token balance.",
  "overlooked_constraints": "The only constraint is that the attacker must have admin privileges or be colluding with the admin. Additionally, the contract\u2019s token balance might limit the practical payout if it is insufficient; however, the computation itself is flawed and can be exploited to appear to yield a profit relative to the original deposit.",
  "variables_to_exclude": [
    "There are no variables that should be excluded in this context because the vulnerability directly hinges on the admin-controlled variables releasePercentageFromDays and getReferalBonusFromDays. Their manipulation is central to the identified risk."
  ],
  "additional_conditions": "For a successful attack, it is required that the admin keys are compromised or that the admin willingly sets arbitrary high values. In systems where admin privileges are tightly controlled and audited, the risk is reduced, but still present if an admin abuse or configuration error occurs.",
  "suggestions": "Recommendations include implementing sanity checks or upper bounds on bonus percentages, using proper governance to set these parameters, and possibly adding time locks or multi-signature approval for changing bonus parameters. This would mitigate the risk of an admin setting values that result in disproportionate withdrawals.",
  "new_focus_areas": "Further analysis should focus on reviewing any other admin-controlled parameters that could impact financial flows in the contract, and on the overall governance and key management practices that might allow such admin-controlled manipulations. Additionally, consider evaluating whether the staking logic could incorporate independent safeguards (e.g., capping payouts relative to the deposit) to limit the impact of anomalous parameter settings.",
