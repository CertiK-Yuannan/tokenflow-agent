  "evaluation": "The audit finding correctly concludes that there is no viable logic vulnerability that lets an attacker manipulate the token flow for profit. The depositAmount is provided by the user and immediately stored as part of the deposit record before transferring tokens via safeTransferFrom. This ensures the recorded deposit amount exactly matches the tokens moved into the contract. The bonus calculations (using releasePercentageFromDays and getReferalBonusFromDays) are directly proportional to the actual deposit values, and the subsequent withdrawal function correctly subtracts previously claimed tokens. Although tokens with fee-on-transfer behavior or admin misconfigurations might introduce other challenges, these do not create an exploitable manipulation that would allow an attacker to extract extra tokens without depositing the corresponding amount.",
  "critical_flaws": "None identified. The control flow, recording, and arithmetic operations ensure that any attempt to abuse the system would require actual token deposits, and any nonstandard token behavior would affect both the bonus and the actual token flow uniformly.",
  "overlooked_constraints": "While the analysis did not account for tokens with fee-on-transfer (which could theoretically lead to a difference between transferred and recorded amounts), such behavior would affect overall staking and bonus calculations in a predictable manner rather than producing a net profit by manipulation. Admin parameters are adjustable only by a privileged account, so they do not lower the security of the system for regular users.",
