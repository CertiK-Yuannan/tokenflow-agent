  "evaluation": "The audit finding correctly identifies a weakness in the reward calculation logic. The referrer bonus is computed by taking the caller\u2019s (msg.sender\u2019s) referalEarning value and adding the tokenAmount, then multiplying by a bonus percentage derived from a user\u2011controlled _days parameter. Because there is no normalization or cap on how many deposits can be made, an attacker who controls several accounts (or uses colluding accounts) can repeatedly call stakeTokensV3 with favorable parameters to inflate referral earnings. Moreover, the aggregation in availableAmountForClaim sums all deposits and referral earnings, so the final claimable amount may far exceed what a well\u2011behaved deposit should produce. The attack scenario is economically viable if the admin has set high percentages via releasePercentageFromDays and getReferalBonusFromDays, and it relies on variables directly controlled by users (_days and tokenAmount).",
  "critical_flaws": "There are no major flaws in the audit finding itself. However, its success depends on the admin-configured parameters. In an environment where these parameters are kept conservative, the window of exploitation may be limited.",
  "overlooked_constraints": "The finding does not explicitly state that the practical exploit depends on misconfiguration (i.e., very generous bonus percentages) and the ability to repeatedly deposit. In a real\u2011world scenario, if the admin sets reasonable limits, the financial gain could be negligible. Also, although the check \u2018msg.sender != _referrer\u2019 prevents self\u2011referral outright, a network of colluding accounts can still be used to bypass this.",
  "variables_to_exclude": "Variables such as depositCount, totalTokensStaked, userDepositCounts, and userTotalTokenStaked are non\u2011malicious bookkeeping aside from calculating accrued rewards. The primary focus should remain on the user-controlled parameters: tokenAmount, _days, and the referral state variables (users[_userAddress].referalEarning and stakeReferal).",
  "additional_conditions": "For a successful attack, a few conditions must be met: (1) the attacker must have access to a sufficient number of tokens to make repeated deposits, (2) the admin must have set the reward percentages (releasePercentageFromDays and getReferalBonusFromDays) high enough to allow excessive accrual, and (3) there must be no off\u2011chain controls limiting the frequency or size of deposits. Without these conditions, the exploit would be much less impactful.",
  "suggestions": "It would be beneficial to review any mechanisms that could limit the number of deposits per user or enforce stricter referral relationship checks. Normalizing the referral bonus calculation so that it does not compound using already inflated values would also help. Additional audits could focus on adding upper bounds to reward accrual and verifying that all user\u2010controlled parameters are sanitized or capped appropriately.",
  "new_focus_areas": "Future analysis should concentrate on deposit aggregation methods, ensuring that referral bonus calculations isolate the value of each individual deposit without cumulative inflation, and enforcing stricter controls on user\u2011provided parameters such as the staking duration (_days). Further examination of how rewards are released (including time\u2010based multipliers) may also help identify other potential vector abuses.",
