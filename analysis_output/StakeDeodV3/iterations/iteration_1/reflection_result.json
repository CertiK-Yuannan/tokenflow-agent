  "evaluation": "The finding correctly identifies an area where the design allows an attacker to pick any _days value at staking time, which in turn is used as a key into the bonus mappings (releasePercentageFromDays and getReferalBonusFromDays). These mappings are only settable by the admin, so under normal circumstances the bonus percentages should be set to sensible values. However, if an admin inadvertently or maliciously sets an extremely high bonus for a specific _days key, an attacker can indeed choose that same _days value when staking tokens. The bonus calculation in availableAmountForClaim will then multiply the deposit amount by an abnormally high percentage over even one period, allowing the withdrawal of a token amount that far exceeds the original deposit. In this sense the logic does create a vulnerability if the parameters are not properly bounded or validated (i.e. there is no enforced maximum value for _days or checks on the corresponding bonus percentages).",
  "critical_flaws": "The vulnerability is predicated on extreme misconfiguration by the admin. In a normally secured system, the admin would set reasonable limits, thereby preventing the abuse. An attacker outside of admin control cannot force high bonus percentages\u2014they can only choose a _days value that the admin has already misconfigured. Thus, while the code logic is vulnerable to bonus parameter manipulation due to an unbounded _days input, the actual risk depends on proper administrative practices.",
  "overlooked_constraints": "The attack scenario requires that the bonus mappings (releasePercentageFromDays and getReferalBonusFromDays) have been set to unreasonably high values for a chosen _days key. Since these values are under admin control, if the admin enforces proper bounds and validation in the UI or back\u2010end procedures, then this vulnerability could be mitigated. Additionally, the staking logic relies on time and bonus calculations that naturally limit the payout if the staking period is not sufficiently elapsed.",
  "variables_to_exclude": [
    "The _days variable itself is user\u2013controlled and not inherently dangerous; the mapping values that correspond to it (monthlyPercentage and referalPercentage) should be the focus. Also, internal state variables such as depositCount and userStakedStatus are not directly involved in the exploit and should be excluded from the manipulation analysis."
  ],
  "additional_conditions": "For the attack to be successful, it is necessary that (1) the admin sets one or both bonus percentages to an unreasonably high value for at least one _days key, and (2) the attacker has sufficient tokens to stake. Without an administrative misconfiguration or deliberate misuse, there is no inherent mechanism for a user to arbitrarily inflate the bonus values.",
  "suggestions": "If the goal is to safeguard against such potential abuse, then it would be advisable to validate that the _days parameter falls within a reasonable range (for example, imposing a maximum staking duration). In addition, administrative functions that set bonus parameters should include constraints or sanity checks to prevent setting extreme values. Auditing the procedures that manage these configurations could also preempt misconfiguration risks.",
  "new_focus_areas": "Further analysis should concentrate on the administrative pathways for setting bonus percentages. In particular, verifying that the admin UI, deployment scripts, or governance procedures enforce safe limits on _days and its mapping values would be beneficial. It would also be useful to analyze if there are any upgradeability or access control patterns that might allow an attacker to inadvertently or maliciously influence admin settings.",
