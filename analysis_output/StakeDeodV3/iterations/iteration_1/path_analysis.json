User initiates staking by calling stakeTokensV3 with the amount they want to stake (tokenAmount),\n//    a referrer address, and a chosen staking period (days).\n// 2. Within stakeTokensV3, a Deposit record is created in depositInfo where depositAmount is set to tokenAmount.\n//    This depositAmount serves as the base for calculating monthly bonuses (using monthlyPercentage)\n//    and later influences what amount is withdrawable.\n// 3. The tokens are transferred from the user's wallet to the contract.\n// 4. Later, when the user checks for claimable tokens (or initiates a withdrawal),\n//    availableAmountForClaim iterates over each deposit and uses deposit.depositAmount and other parameters\n//    (like monthly bonus percentage) to calculate the total claimable balance.\n// 5. Finally, withdrawTokensV3 transfers tokens back to the user based on these calculations,\n//    reflecting the role depositInfo[*].depositAmount plays in the token flow.\n\n\n// End of PSEUDO-CODE REPRESENTATION\n\n// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n// NOTE:\n// - The depositInfo[*].depositAmount variable is directly set by the user\u2019s input in stakeTokensV3,\n//   and is later used to compute bonus accruals, affecting withdrawal amounts.\n// - The stakeTokensV3 function is central to both recording the staking deposit and initializing\n//   the token flow (with a call to safeTransferFrom) that moves tokens into the contract.\n// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------",
