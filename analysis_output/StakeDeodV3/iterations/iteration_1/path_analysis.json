  "code_path": "The token flow begins in stakeTokensV3 where the user-controlled values are recorded (depositInfo[x].depositAmount and depositInfo[x].timePeriodInDays) and referral earnings are updated. Then the availableAmountForClaim function loops over each deposit to compute the matured value (using depositInfo[x].depositAmount, monthlyPercentage, and the elapsed time in 30\u2010day increments) and adds users[_userAddress].referalEarning along with stakeReferal[_userAddress] before subtraction of withdrawnAmount. Finally, withdrawTokensV3 calls safeTransfer to send out the computed tokens.",
  "analysis_focus": "Variables that are easy to manipulate include depositInfo[x].depositAmount and depositInfo[x].timePeriodInDays (which the user sets while staking) as well as users[_userAddress].referalEarning and stakeReferal[_userAddress] (which are accrued through referral logic in stakeTokensV3).",
  "manipulation_strategy": "A user may choose an abnormally high tokenAmount and adjust the _days parameter (staking duration) to maximize the computed per\u2010month bonus (by invoking a deposit with a high monthlyPercentage if the corresponding releasePercentageFromDays mapping is high). Furthermore, by carefully providing a referrer address, a user could influence the referral bonus computation so that both the direct referral bonus (users[_userAddress].referalEarning) and the indirect bonus (stakeReferal[_userAddress]) are increased. In effect, a malicious staker could deposit extremely high amounts and set extreme durations to artificially inflate the available claimable tokens when availableAmountForClaim is computed.",
  "expected_impact": "If manipulation is successful, the contract could over-calculate the amount claimable by the user, which might allow the user to withdraw significantly more tokens than expected relative to their actual stake. This could lead to a drain of the contract\u2019s token reserve because the safeTransfer call sends out an inflated token amount.",
  "assumptions": "It is assumed that users have full control over the deposit amount and their chosen staking duration (_days) during stakeTokensV3, and that referral bonus percentages (via getReferalBonusFromDays and releasePercentageFromDays) are set to values that could be exploited. It is also assumed that there is insufficient additional validation or limits on these parameters, making them vulnerable to abuse.",
