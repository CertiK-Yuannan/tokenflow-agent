In addition, by specifying a referrer address (or by being the referrer), they can indirectly increase their referral earnings (users[_userAddress].referalEarning). The strategy involves stacking multiple deposits to maximize the cumulative rewards computed in availableAmountForClaim.

    "expected_impact": "If a user is able to repeatedly create deposits with favorable parameters, they could artificially inflate their overall claimable token amount. This might lead to unexpectedly high withdrawal amounts based on the compounded rewards (both from staking and referrals) being drawn from the contract, potentially disrupting the intended token flow and economic balances of the staking ecosystem.",
    "assumptions": "It is assumed that the user is able to interact with the staking function at will (i.e., no off\u2011chain restrictions or UI limitations control the parameters passed to stakeTokensV3). It is also assumed that the admin-set percentages (releasePercentageFromDays and getReferalBonusFromDays) are set to values that significantly impact the reward calculation. Finally, it is assumed that the only controls over withdrawals are the calculations in availableAmountForClaim, as tokens are transferred based solely on the input parameters that the user can manipulate via staking.",

    "attack_scenario": "An attacker who controls one or more externally owned accounts (or a network of colluding accounts) can abuse the fact that the reward\u2010calculation logic aggregates rewards across an arbitrary number of deposits and uses user\u2010controlled parameters (tokenAmount and _days) in both the staking and referral bonus formulas. In stakeTokensV3 the referral bonus is computed using (user.referalEarning.add(tokenAmount)) multiplied by a percentage (getReferalBonusFromDays[_days]) with no check that the bonus is based solely on the deposit amount. (Note that \u2018user\u2019 here is actually msg.sender so it is confusingly used in place of what should be the referrer\u2019s own state.) As a result, by depositing repeatedly with \u201cfavorable\u201d parameters (for example, choosing a _days value for which the admin\u2010set percentages are very generous) and by \u201creferencing\u201d colluding accounts (or even inadvertently boosting one\u2019s own referral earnings via cross\u2011calls), an attacker can \u201cstack\u201d deposits so that the aggregated claimable amount computed by availableAmountForClaim far exceeds what one would expect from a single well\u2010behaved deposit. When the withdrawal function is called, the contract transfers the entire computed available amount (which now includes both the maturity rewards from the deposit(s) and an inflated referral bonus) from the contract balance. In an environment where the percentages were misconfigured or left \u201copen\u201d (e.g. the admin sets very high releasePercentageFromDays or getReferalBonusFromDays values), the attacker may be able to extract amounts that significantly exceed the intended yield on funds, effectively profiting from the manipulation of the calculation.",
    "exploit_code": "/* Example Transaction Sequence (pseudocode using a testing framework):\n\n   // Assume attacker controls two accounts: Attacker_A and Attacker_B\n   // Attacker_B will serve as the referrer in many deposits from Attacker_A\n\n   // 1. Attacker_A approves the staking contract for a high tokenAmount\n   token.approve(stakingContract.address, depositAmount);\n\n   // 2. Attacker_A calls stakeTokensV3 with _referrer = Attacker_B and with a _days value for which getReferalBonusFromDays and releasePercentageFromDays have been set high by admin\n   stakingContract.stakeTokensV3(depositAmount, attackerBAddress, favorableDaysValue);\n\n   // 3. Repeat the above call many times. Each call will add a new deposit record into userDepositIds[attackerAAddress] and it will also inflate the referral bonus for Attacker_B because the bonus is computed as\n   //    bonus = (users[attackerAAddress].referalEarning + depositAmount) * getReferalBonusFromDays[favorableDaysValue] / 1000\n   //    and then added to the referral earning of Attacker_B.

After waiting for sufficient time to accrue rewards (i.e. enough 30-day periods for each deposit), Attacker_A (or Attacker_B, depending on the caller in each withdraw) calls withdrawTokensV3 to pull out the sum of:\n   //    - The maturity rewards on all deposits (which include the original deposit amount plus the bonus computed monthly)\n   //    - The aggregated referral bonus that has been inflated by repeated calls.\n\n   // The end result is that the tokens transferred to the attacker are far higher than what a single deposit (or even an intended limited number of deposits) would generate.\n\n   // Pseudocode for a withdraw transaction:\n   stakingContract.withdrawTokensV3(attackerAAddress);\n   \n*/",
    "profit_mechanism": "By stacking many deposits under one account and boosting the referral bonus with carefully chosen parameters (via the _days argument and the associated bonus percentages), the attacker causes the availableAmountForClaim calculation to sum up an artificially high amount of tokens. When these rewards are withdrawn, the transferred amount (which is computed as deposit rewards plus referral earnings minus any previous withdrawals) far exceeds what would normally be allowed by a single deposit. This repeated inflation of rewards (both via the deposit\u2019s own reward accrual and via referral bonus) gives the attacker a net profit relative to the value that was originally staked.",
    "attack_prerequisites": "1. The attacker must control sufficient tokens to make large deposits repeatedly. 2. The attacker must be able to call stakeTokensV3 arbitrarily often (i.e. there are no off\u2010chain or frontend restrictions limiting the number or parameters of deposits). 3. The admin\u2010assigned percentages in releasePercentageFromDays and getReferalBonusFromDays must be set to values that allow excessive accumulation of rewards (whether intentionally or by misconfiguration). 4. The referral bonus logic must be exploitable via colluding accounts or by indirect manipulation (the bonus formula mistakenly uses the caller\u2019s referalEarning state rather than being isolated for the intended referrer).",
    "attack_limitations": "\u2022 The attacker must wait for the necessary time (at least in multiples of 30 days, as determined by the deposit timestamp) to accrue rewards; immediate extraction is not possible if the rewards are time\u2011based. \n\u2022 The amount extracted is ultimately limited by the token balance held in the contract (which is initially funded only through user deposits). \n\u2022 If the admin appropriately configures the percentages (or later tightens deposit parameters), the window for manipulation may be reduced or closed. \n\u2022 The contract\u2019s pause capability (controlled by the owner) can prevent withdrawals if triggered.",
    "confidence": "high",
    "reasoning": "The core of the exploit lies in the fact that the reward and referral bonus calculations are both parameterized by values that an attacker can control (tokenAmount and _days) and the aggregation of rewards across an unbounded number of deposits via userDepositIds. In stakeTokensV3, the bonus that is attributed to a referrer is computed using the caller\u2019s referalEarning state combined with the deposit amount and then assigned to the referrer. This gives a vector for artificially inflating the bonus if the attacker uses multiple deposits and possibly colluding referrers. The availableAmountForClaim then aggregates over all such deposits without any safeguards that limit or \u201cnormalize\u201d the reward accrual. As a result, an attacker who is willing to front the deposit tokens (which are later returned along with rewards) can, by repeatedly depositing with favorable parameters, manipulate the calculated claimable amount to extract a disproportionately high amount of tokens. This analysis examines the key manipulated variables (depositAmount, timePeriodInDays/_days, and referral earnings) and shows that their interplay leads to a feasible attack scenario.",

    "evaluation": "The audit finding correctly identifies a weakness in the reward calculation logic. The referrer bonus is computed by taking the caller\u2019s (msg.sender\u2019s) referalEarning value and adding the tokenAmount, then multiplying by a bonus percentage derived from a user\u2011controlled _days parameter. Because there is no normalization or cap on how many deposits can be made, an attacker who controls several accounts (or uses colluding accounts) can repeatedly call stakeTokensV3 with favorable parameters to inflate referral earnings. Moreover, the aggregation in availableAmountForClaim sums all deposits and referral earnings, so the final claimable amount may far exceed what a well\u2011behaved deposit should produce. The attack scenario is economically viable if the admin has set high percentages via releasePercentageFromDays and getReferalBonusFromDays, and it relies on variables directly controlled by users (_days and tokenAmount).",
    "critical_flaws": "There are no major flaws in the audit finding itself. However, its success depends on the admin-configured parameters. In an environment where these parameters are kept conservative, the window of exploitation may be limited.",
    "overlooked_constraints": "The finding does not explicitly state that the practical exploit depends on misconfiguration (i.e., very generous bonus percentages) and the ability to repeatedly deposit. In a real\u2011world scenario, if the admin sets reasonable limits, the financial gain could be negligible. Also, although the check \u2018msg.sender != _referrer\u2019 prevents self\u2011referral outright, a network of colluding accounts can still be used to bypass this.",
    "variables_to_exclude": "Variables such as depositCount, totalTokensStaked, userDepositCounts, and userTotalTokenStaked are non\u2011malicious bookkeeping aside from calculating accrued rewards. The primary focus should remain on the user-controlled parameters: tokenAmount, _days, and the referral state variables (users[_userAddress].referalEarning and stakeReferal).",
    "additional_conditions": "For a successful attack, a few conditions must be met: (1) the attacker must have access to a sufficient number of tokens to make repeated deposits, (2) the admin must have set the reward percentages (releasePercentageFromDays and getReferalBonusFromDays) high enough to allow excessive accrual, and (3) there must be no off\u2011chain controls limiting the frequency or size of deposits. Without these conditions, the exploit would be much less impactful.",
    "suggestions": "It would be beneficial to review any mechanisms that could limit the number of deposits per user or enforce stricter referral relationship checks. Normalizing the referral bonus calculation so that it does not compound using already inflated values would also help. Additional audits could focus on adding upper bounds to reward accrual and verifying that all user\u2010controlled parameters are sanitized or capped appropriately.",
    "new_focus_areas": "Future analysis should concentrate on deposit aggregation methods, ensuring that referral bonus calculations isolate the value of each individual deposit without cumulative inflation, and enforcing stricter controls on user\u2011provided parameters such as the staking duration (_days). Further examination of how rewards are released (including time\u2010based multipliers) may also help identify other potential vector abuses.",
