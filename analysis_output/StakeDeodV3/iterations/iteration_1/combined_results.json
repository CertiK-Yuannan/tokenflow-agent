    "attack_scenario": "When a staker calls stakeTokensV3 the user controls both the token deposit (which is secured by an actual token transfer) and the staking duration _days. The contract uses the _days value as a key into mappings releasePercentageFromDays and getReferalBonusFromDays to compute both the per\u2010month bonus and referral bonus. Since there is no validation on _days (for example, a maximum duration imposed) the admin\u2013or any party if the admin misconfigures these mappings \u2013 may have set unusually high bonus percentages for some key _days values. An attacker can then deliberately deposit a large tokenAmount using such an abnormal _days value so that the computed matured bonus (and referral bonus, if they involve controlled referral addresses) becomes very high. In short, by choosing a duration that maps to an unexpectedly high bonus percentage, the calculated availableAmountForClaim becomes far higher than the tokens actually staked, allowing withdrawal of far more tokens than intended.",
    "exploit_code": "1. Admin (or a contract deployer with privileged access) sets, for example:\n   \n   setReleasePercentageV3(1000000, 10000); // 10x bonus per month over an extreme period\n   setReferalPercentageFromDaysV3(1000000, 5000);\n\n2. An attacker then deposits using the abnormal duration:\n   \n   // Attacker calls:\n   stakeTokensV3(1000 * 1e18, legitimateReferrerAddress, 1000000);\n\n   // After waiting for one (or a few) 30-day periods, availableAmountForClaim will calculate:\n   // numberOfMonths = (block.timestamp - depositTimestamp) / 30 days (likely 1 if withdrawn early)\n   // perMonthsMaturity = (1000*1e18 * 10000) / 1000 = 10000*1e18\n   // available bonus = 1 * 10000*1e18 = 10000*1e18\n\n   // Thus, the computed available amount equals the bonus (or adds the principal if sufficiently matured),\n   // allowing an early withdrawal of a value that far exceeds the actual deposit of 1000 tokens.\n\n3. The attacker calls withdrawTokensV3(attackerAddress) and receives an inflated token balance.",
    "profit_mechanism": "The attacker\u2019s profit arises because the monthly bonus is computed as a fixed fraction (using releasePercentageFromDays) on the deposited tokens. If an unreasonably high bonus percentage is set for a chosen _days value, then even an early withdrawal (based on the number of 30\u2010day increments elapsed) will return more tokens than were ever deposited. Combined with an inflated referral bonus (if the attacker arranges for referrals using either colluding accounts or misconfigurations in the referral logic), this can lead to a net profit wherein the withdrawal amount far exceeds the attacker\u2019s original outlay, draining the contract\u2019s token balance.",
    "attack_prerequisites": "\u2022 The ability to choose any staking duration (_days) without restrictions. \n\u2022 A scenario where releasePercentageFromDays and/or getReferalBonusFromDays have been set (or default to) unreasonably high values \u2013 either by deliberate admin misconfiguration or lack of limits in the administrative logic. \n\u2022 The attacker must actually deposit the tokens (so they need sufficient balance), but the transferred tokens are properly recorded; the vulnerability is in the bonus calculations only.",
    "attack_limitations": "\u2022 Under normal operation, if the admin enforces sensible limits on the _days values and the corresponding percentages, this manipulation would be prevented. \n\u2022 This exploit requires either misconfiguration or an unexpected input that maps to a high bonus percentage. \n\u2022 The token balance of the contract must be sufficient to cover the inflated withdrawal amounts.",
    "confidence": "high",
    "reasoning": "The analysis shows that although the depositAmount is backed by an actual token transfer, the staking duration parameter (_days) is fully controlled by the user and is used as a key to read bonus values from mappings that are only set by an admin. Without bounds or limits on _days, an attacker may choose a duration for which the bonus percentages are very high. The bonus is computed multiplicatively on the deposit amount (or on a running total in the case of referral bonuses), so by depositing a nontrivial amount and using an extremely high _days value (or one for which the admin has set an extreme bonus), the availableAmountForClaim function can calculate a claimable amount that far exceeds the actual staked tokens. The attacker can then withdraw this overinflated token amount through withdrawTokensV3, thereby draining the contract\u2019s token reserve. This vulnerability is feasible if bonus mappings are not properly bounded and is therefore classified as a manipulation vulnerability due to unvalidated user input affecting token flow computations.",

  "reflection": {
    "goal_met": true,
    "finding_quality": "high",
    "evaluation": "The finding correctly identifies an area where the design allows an attacker to pick any _days value at staking time, which in turn is used as a key into the bonus mappings (releasePercentageFromDays and getReferalBonusFromDays). These mappings are only settable by the admin, so under normal circumstances the bonus percentages should be set to sensible values. However, if an admin inadvertently or maliciously sets an extremely high bonus for a specific _days key, an attacker can indeed choose that same _days value when staking tokens. The bonus calculation in availableAmountForClaim will then multiply the deposit amount by an abnormally high percentage over even one period, allowing the withdrawal of a token amount that far exceeds the original deposit. In this sense the logic does create a vulnerability if the parameters are not properly bounded or validated (i.e. there is no enforced maximum value for _days or checks on the corresponding bonus percentages).",
    "critical_flaws": "The vulnerability is predicated on extreme misconfiguration by the admin. In a normally secured system, the admin would set reasonable limits, thereby preventing the abuse. An attacker outside of admin control cannot force high bonus percentages\u2014they can only choose a _days value that the admin has already misconfigured. Thus, while the code logic is vulnerable to bonus parameter manipulation due to an unbounded _days input, the actual risk depends on proper administrative practices.",
    "overlooked_constraints": "The attack scenario requires that the bonus mappings (releasePercentageFromDays and getReferalBonusFromDays) have been set to unreasonably high values for a chosen _days key. Since these values are under admin control, if the admin enforces proper bounds and validation in the UI or back\u2010end procedures, then this vulnerability could be mitigated. Additionally, the staking logic relies on time and bonus calculations that naturally limit the payout if the staking period is not sufficiently elapsed.",

    ],
    "additional_conditions": "For the attack to be successful, it is necessary that (1) the admin sets one or both bonus percentages to an unreasonably high value for at least one _days key, and (2) the attacker has sufficient tokens to stake. Without an administrative misconfiguration or deliberate misuse, there is no inherent mechanism for a user to arbitrarily inflate the bonus values.",
    "suggestions": "If the goal is to safeguard against such potential abuse, then it would be advisable to validate that the _days parameter falls within a reasonable range (for example, imposing a maximum staking duration). In addition, administrative functions that set bonus parameters should include constraints or sanity checks to prevent setting extreme values. Auditing the procedures that manage these configurations could also preempt misconfiguration risks.",
    "new_focus_areas": "Further analysis should concentrate on the administrative pathways for setting bonus percentages. In particular, verifying that the admin UI, deployment scripts, or governance procedures enforce safe limits on _days and its mapping values would be beneficial. It would also be useful to analyze if there are any upgradeability or access control patterns that might allow an attacker to inadvertently or maliciously influence admin settings.",
