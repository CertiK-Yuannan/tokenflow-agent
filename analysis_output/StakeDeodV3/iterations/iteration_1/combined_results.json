User initiates staking by calling stakeTokensV3 with the amount they want to stake (tokenAmount),\n//    a referrer address, and a chosen staking period (days).\n// 2. Within stakeTokensV3, a Deposit record is created in depositInfo where depositAmount is set to tokenAmount.\n//    This depositAmount serves as the base for calculating monthly bonuses (using monthlyPercentage)\n//    and later influences what amount is withdrawable.\n// 3. The tokens are transferred from the user's wallet to the contract.\n// 4. Later, when the user checks for claimable tokens (or initiates a withdrawal),\n//    availableAmountForClaim iterates over each deposit and uses deposit.depositAmount and other parameters\n//    (like monthly bonus percentage) to calculate the total claimable balance.\n// 5. Finally, withdrawTokensV3 transfers tokens back to the user based on these calculations,\n//    reflecting the role depositInfo[*].depositAmount plays in the token flow.\n\n\n// End of PSEUDO-CODE REPRESENTATION\n\n// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n// NOTE:\n// - The depositInfo[*].depositAmount variable is directly set by the user\u2019s input in stakeTokensV3,\n//   and is later used to compute bonus accruals, affecting withdrawal amounts.\n// - The stakeTokensV3 function is central to both recording the staking deposit and initializing\n//   the token flow (with a call to safeTransferFrom) that moves tokens into the contract.\n// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------",

Although depositAmount is provided by the user, it is immediately recorded and then used in bonus calculations that exactly reflect the tokens that were transferred in. In addition, withdrawals subtract previously claimed tokens so the overall token flow remains balanced.",

    "attack_prerequisites": "",
    "attack_limitations": "Any attempt to abuse the system (for example by creating many deposits or trying to use referral logic) would involve staking actual tokens. The bonus is linearly computed from the deposit without any inconsistency, and safeTransferFrom and safeTransfer operate as expected. Also, any non\u2010standard token behavior (such as fee\u2010on\u2010transfer) would affect both the actual token flow and the bonus calculations in a manner that is not exploitable by an attacker under normal operation.",
    "edge_cases": "The only potential issues might relate to tokens with fees on transfer or misconfigured admin parameters (e.g. setting excessively high bonus percentages). However, these cases do not offer a user-controlled manipulation that produces a net profit without depositing the corresponding tokens.",
    "confidence": "high",
    "reasons_if_not_feasible": "The deposit amount is recorded before the token transfer, but if safeTransferFrom fails, the entire transaction reverts. Furthermore, the bonus accrual logic is directly proportional to the actual deposited amount and already withdrawn tokens are subtracted from the claimable amount. There is no reentrancy possibility (per defined assumptions) nor any post facto update to depositInfo that would allow an attacker to inflate their claimable amount.",
    "reasoning": "Step\u2010by\u2010step, the stakeTokensV3 function increments depositCount, records user deposit info including the exact tokenAmount supplied by the user, and then calls safeTransferFrom to move tokens into custody. Later, availableAmountForClaim iterates over each deposit and computes bonus accruals directly from the recorded depositAmount. The withdrawTokensV3 function calculates the net amount based on deposits and previously withdrawn tokens. Under these conditions, there is no viable sequence of transactions that would allow an attacker to receive tokens above what they have staked plus the predefined bonus accruals.",

    "evaluation": "The audit finding correctly concludes that there is no viable logic vulnerability that lets an attacker manipulate the token flow for profit. The depositAmount is provided by the user and immediately stored as part of the deposit record before transferring tokens via safeTransferFrom. This ensures the recorded deposit amount exactly matches the tokens moved into the contract. The bonus calculations (using releasePercentageFromDays and getReferalBonusFromDays) are directly proportional to the actual deposit values, and the subsequent withdrawal function correctly subtracts previously claimed tokens. Although tokens with fee-on-transfer behavior or admin misconfigurations might introduce other challenges, these do not create an exploitable manipulation that would allow an attacker to extract extra tokens without depositing the corresponding amount.",
    "critical_flaws": "None identified. The control flow, recording, and arithmetic operations ensure that any attempt to abuse the system would require actual token deposits, and any nonstandard token behavior would affect both the bonus and the actual token flow uniformly.",
    "overlooked_constraints": "While the analysis did not account for tokens with fee-on-transfer (which could theoretically lead to a difference between transferred and recorded amounts), such behavior would affect overall staking and bonus calculations in a predictable manner rather than producing a net profit by manipulation. Admin parameters are adjustable only by a privileged account, so they do not lower the security of the system for regular users.",
