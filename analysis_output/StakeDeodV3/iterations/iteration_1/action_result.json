  "vulnerability_type": "Reward Calculation Manipulation via Repeated Deposits and Referral Bonus Inflation",
  "attack_scenario": "An attacker who controls one or more externally owned accounts (or a network of colluding accounts) can abuse the fact that the reward\u2010calculation logic aggregates rewards across an arbitrary number of deposits and uses user\u2010controlled parameters (tokenAmount and _days) in both the staking and referral bonus formulas. In stakeTokensV3 the referral bonus is computed using (user.referalEarning.add(tokenAmount)) multiplied by a percentage (getReferalBonusFromDays[_days]) with no check that the bonus is based solely on the deposit amount. (Note that \u2018user\u2019 here is actually msg.sender so it is confusingly used in place of what should be the referrer\u2019s own state.) As a result, by depositing repeatedly with \u201cfavorable\u201d parameters (for example, choosing a _days value for which the admin\u2010set percentages are very generous) and by \u201creferencing\u201d colluding accounts (or even inadvertently boosting one\u2019s own referral earnings via cross\u2011calls), an attacker can \u201cstack\u201d deposits so that the aggregated claimable amount computed by availableAmountForClaim far exceeds what one would expect from a single well\u2010behaved deposit. When the withdrawal function is called, the contract transfers the entire computed available amount (which now includes both the maturity rewards from the deposit(s) and an inflated referral bonus) from the contract balance. In an environment where the percentages were misconfigured or left \u201copen\u201d (e.g. the admin sets very high releasePercentageFromDays or getReferalBonusFromDays values), the attacker may be able to extract amounts that significantly exceed the intended yield on funds, effectively profiting from the manipulation of the calculation.",
  "exploit_code": "/* Example Transaction Sequence (pseudocode using a testing framework):\n\n   // Assume attacker controls two accounts: Attacker_A and Attacker_B\n   // Attacker_B will serve as the referrer in many deposits from Attacker_A\n\n   // 1. Attacker_A approves the staking contract for a high tokenAmount\n   token.approve(stakingContract.address, depositAmount);\n\n   // 2. Attacker_A calls stakeTokensV3 with _referrer = Attacker_B and with a _days value for which getReferalBonusFromDays and releasePercentageFromDays have been set high by admin\n   stakingContract.stakeTokensV3(depositAmount, attackerBAddress, favorableDaysValue);\n\n   // 3. Repeat the above call many times. Each call will add a new deposit record into userDepositIds[attackerAAddress] and it will also inflate the referral bonus for Attacker_B because the bonus is computed as\n   //    bonus = (users[attackerAAddress].referalEarning + depositAmount) * getReferalBonusFromDays[favorableDaysValue] / 1000\n   //    and then added to the referral earning of Attacker_B. (Note the mishandling in the bonus calculation.)\n\n   // 4. After waiting for sufficient time to accrue rewards (i.e. enough 30-day periods for each deposit), Attacker_A (or Attacker_B, depending on the caller in each withdraw) calls withdrawTokensV3 to pull out the sum of:\n   //    - The maturity rewards on all deposits (which include the original deposit amount plus the bonus computed monthly)\n   //    - The aggregated referral bonus that has been inflated by repeated calls.\n\n   // The end result is that the tokens transferred to the attacker are far higher than what a single deposit (or even an intended limited number of deposits) would generate.\n\n   // Pseudocode for a withdraw transaction:\n   stakingContract.withdrawTokensV3(attackerAAddress);\n   \n*/",
  "profit_mechanism": "By stacking many deposits under one account and boosting the referral bonus with carefully chosen parameters (via the _days argument and the associated bonus percentages), the attacker causes the availableAmountForClaim calculation to sum up an artificially high amount of tokens. When these rewards are withdrawn, the transferred amount (which is computed as deposit rewards plus referral earnings minus any previous withdrawals) far exceeds what would normally be allowed by a single deposit. This repeated inflation of rewards (both via the deposit\u2019s own reward accrual and via referral bonus) gives the attacker a net profit relative to the value that was originally staked.",
  "attack_prerequisites": "1. The attacker must control sufficient tokens to make large deposits repeatedly. 2. The attacker must be able to call stakeTokensV3 arbitrarily often (i.e. there are no off\u2010chain or frontend restrictions limiting the number or parameters of deposits). 3. The admin\u2010assigned percentages in releasePercentageFromDays and getReferalBonusFromDays must be set to values that allow excessive accumulation of rewards (whether intentionally or by misconfiguration). 4. The referral bonus logic must be exploitable via colluding accounts or by indirect manipulation (the bonus formula mistakenly uses the caller\u2019s referalEarning state rather than being isolated for the intended referrer).",
  "attack_limitations": "\u2022 The attacker must wait for the necessary time (at least in multiples of 30 days, as determined by the deposit timestamp) to accrue rewards; immediate extraction is not possible if the rewards are time\u2011based. \n\u2022 The amount extracted is ultimately limited by the token balance held in the contract (which is initially funded only through user deposits). \n\u2022 If the admin appropriately configures the percentages (or later tightens deposit parameters), the window for manipulation may be reduced or closed. \n\u2022 The contract\u2019s pause capability (controlled by the owner) can prevent withdrawals if triggered.",
  "confidence": "high",
  "reasoning": "The core of the exploit lies in the fact that the reward and referral bonus calculations are both parameterized by values that an attacker can control (tokenAmount and _days) and the aggregation of rewards across an unbounded number of deposits via userDepositIds. In stakeTokensV3, the bonus that is attributed to a referrer is computed using the caller\u2019s referalEarning state combined with the deposit amount and then assigned to the referrer. This gives a vector for artificially inflating the bonus if the attacker uses multiple deposits and possibly colluding referrers. The availableAmountForClaim then aggregates over all such deposits without any safeguards that limit or \u201cnormalize\u201d the reward accrual. As a result, an attacker who is willing to front the deposit tokens (which are later returned along with rewards) can, by repeatedly depositing with favorable parameters, manipulate the calculated claimable amount to extract a disproportionately high amount of tokens. This analysis examines the key manipulated variables (depositAmount, timePeriodInDays/_days, and referral earnings) and shows that their interplay leads to a feasible attack scenario.",
  "analysis_metadata": {
    "iteration": 0,
    "analysis_focus": "The calculations in availableAmountForClaim that use depositInfo[].depositAmount, depositInfo[].timePeriodInDays, and users[_userAddress].referalEarning, along with the accumulation of deposits via userDepositIds, represent the core of the token flow. The input parameters of stakeTokensV3 (tokenAmount, _days, and _referrer) are directly controlled by a user, and these values significantly affect the eventual withdrawal amount.",
    "manipulation_strategy": "A user can manipulate the overall available withdrawal amount by repeatedly calling stakeTokensV3 with carefully chosen parameters. The user can deposit high token amounts (depositInfo[].depositAmount) and select a long staking duration (_days) to increase the maturityMonths, thereby increasing the multiplier for reward accrual. In addition, by specifying a referrer address (or by being the referrer), they can indirectly increase their referral earnings (users[_userAddress].referalEarning). The strategy involves stacking multiple deposits to maximize the cumulative rewards computed in availableAmountForClaim. Note that the require(msg.sender == _userAddress) in withdrawTokensV3 prevents withdrawing tokens for another account, but does not prevent a user from creating multiple deposits to benefit themselves."
