  "vulnerability_found": true,
  "vulnerability_type": "Bonus parameter manipulation due to unbounded _days input",
  "attack_scenario": "When a staker calls stakeTokensV3 the user controls both the token deposit (which is secured by an actual token transfer) and the staking duration _days. The contract uses the _days value as a key into mappings releasePercentageFromDays and getReferalBonusFromDays to compute both the per\u2010month bonus and referral bonus. Since there is no validation on _days (for example, a maximum duration imposed) the admin\u2013or any party if the admin misconfigures these mappings \u2013 may have set unusually high bonus percentages for some key _days values. An attacker can then deliberately deposit a large tokenAmount using such an abnormal _days value so that the computed matured bonus (and referral bonus, if they involve controlled referral addresses) becomes very high. In short, by choosing a duration that maps to an unexpectedly high bonus percentage, the calculated availableAmountForClaim becomes far higher than the tokens actually staked, allowing withdrawal of far more tokens than intended.",
  "exploit_code": "1. Admin (or a contract deployer with privileged access) sets, for example:\n   \n   setReleasePercentageV3(1000000, 10000); // 10x bonus per month over an extreme period\n   setReferalPercentageFromDaysV3(1000000, 5000);\n\n2. An attacker then deposits using the abnormal duration:\n   \n   // Attacker calls:\n   stakeTokensV3(1000 * 1e18, legitimateReferrerAddress, 1000000);\n\n   // After waiting for one (or a few) 30-day periods, availableAmountForClaim will calculate:\n   // numberOfMonths = (block.timestamp - depositTimestamp) / 30 days (likely 1 if withdrawn early)\n   // perMonthsMaturity = (1000*1e18 * 10000) / 1000 = 10000*1e18\n   // available bonus = 1 * 10000*1e18 = 10000*1e18\n\n   // Thus, the computed available amount equals the bonus (or adds the principal if sufficiently matured),\n   // allowing an early withdrawal of a value that far exceeds the actual deposit of 1000 tokens.\n\n3. The attacker calls withdrawTokensV3(attackerAddress) and receives an inflated token balance.",
  "profit_mechanism": "The attacker\u2019s profit arises because the monthly bonus is computed as a fixed fraction (using releasePercentageFromDays) on the deposited tokens. If an unreasonably high bonus percentage is set for a chosen _days value, then even an early withdrawal (based on the number of 30\u2010day increments elapsed) will return more tokens than were ever deposited. Combined with an inflated referral bonus (if the attacker arranges for referrals using either colluding accounts or misconfigurations in the referral logic), this can lead to a net profit wherein the withdrawal amount far exceeds the attacker\u2019s original outlay, draining the contract\u2019s token balance.",
  "attack_prerequisites": "\u2022 The ability to choose any staking duration (_days) without restrictions. \n\u2022 A scenario where releasePercentageFromDays and/or getReferalBonusFromDays have been set (or default to) unreasonably high values \u2013 either by deliberate admin misconfiguration or lack of limits in the administrative logic. \n\u2022 The attacker must actually deposit the tokens (so they need sufficient balance), but the transferred tokens are properly recorded; the vulnerability is in the bonus calculations only.",
  "attack_limitations": "\u2022 Under normal operation, if the admin enforces sensible limits on the _days values and the corresponding percentages, this manipulation would be prevented. \n\u2022 This exploit requires either misconfiguration or an unexpected input that maps to a high bonus percentage. \n\u2022 The token balance of the contract must be sufficient to cover the inflated withdrawal amounts.",
  "confidence": "high",
  "reasoning": "The analysis shows that although the depositAmount is backed by an actual token transfer, the staking duration parameter (_days) is fully controlled by the user and is used as a key to read bonus values from mappings that are only set by an admin. Without bounds or limits on _days, an attacker may choose a duration for which the bonus percentages are very high. The bonus is computed multiplicatively on the deposit amount (or on a running total in the case of referral bonuses), so by depositing a nontrivial amount and using an extremely high _days value (or one for which the admin has set an extreme bonus), the availableAmountForClaim function can calculate a claimable amount that far exceeds the actual staked tokens. The attacker can then withdraw this overinflated token amount through withdrawTokensV3, thereby draining the contract\u2019s token reserve. This vulnerability is feasible if bonus mappings are not properly bounded and is therefore classified as a manipulation vulnerability due to unvalidated user input affecting token flow computations.",
  "analysis_metadata": {
    "iteration": 0,
    "analysis_focus": "Variables that are easy to manipulate include depositInfo[x].depositAmount and depositInfo[x].timePeriodInDays (which the user sets while staking) as well as users[_userAddress].referalEarning and stakeReferal[_userAddress] (which are accrued through referral logic in stakeTokensV3).",
    "manipulation_strategy": "A user may choose an abnormally high tokenAmount and adjust the _days parameter (staking duration) to maximize the computed per\u2010month bonus (by invoking a deposit with a high monthlyPercentage if the corresponding releasePercentageFromDays mapping is high). Furthermore, by carefully providing a referrer address, a user could influence the referral bonus computation so that both the direct referral bonus (users[_userAddress].referalEarning) and the indirect bonus (stakeReferal[_userAddress]) are increased. In effect, a malicious staker could deposit extremely high amounts and set extreme durations to artificially inflate the available claimable tokens when availableAmountForClaim is computed."
