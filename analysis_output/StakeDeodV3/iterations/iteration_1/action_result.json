  "attack_scenario": "After a detailed review of the pseudo\u2010code, we did not identify a scenario where an attacker can manipulate depositInfo[*].depositAmount to extract extra tokens for profit. Although depositAmount is provided by the user, it is immediately recorded and then used in bonus calculations that exactly reflect the tokens that were transferred in. In addition, withdrawals subtract previously claimed tokens so the overall token flow remains balanced.",
  "exploit_code": "",
  "profit_mechanism": "",
  "attack_prerequisites": "",
  "attack_limitations": "Any attempt to abuse the system (for example by creating many deposits or trying to use referral logic) would involve staking actual tokens. The bonus is linearly computed from the deposit without any inconsistency, and safeTransferFrom and safeTransfer operate as expected. Also, any non\u2010standard token behavior (such as fee\u2010on\u2010transfer) would affect both the actual token flow and the bonus calculations in a manner that is not exploitable by an attacker under normal operation.",
  "edge_cases": "The only potential issues might relate to tokens with fees on transfer or misconfigured admin parameters (e.g. setting excessively high bonus percentages). However, these cases do not offer a user-controlled manipulation that produces a net profit without depositing the corresponding tokens.",
  "confidence": "high",
  "reasons_if_not_feasible": "The deposit amount is recorded before the token transfer, but if safeTransferFrom fails, the entire transaction reverts. Furthermore, the bonus accrual logic is directly proportional to the actual deposited amount and already withdrawn tokens are subtracted from the claimable amount. There is no reentrancy possibility (per defined assumptions) nor any post facto update to depositInfo that would allow an attacker to inflate their claimable amount.",
  "reasoning": "Step\u2010by\u2010step, the stakeTokensV3 function increments depositCount, records user deposit info including the exact tokenAmount supplied by the user, and then calls safeTransferFrom to move tokens into custody. Later, availableAmountForClaim iterates over each deposit and computes bonus accruals directly from the recorded depositAmount. The withdrawTokensV3 function calculates the net amount based on deposits and previously withdrawn tokens. Under these conditions, there is no viable sequence of transactions that would allow an attacker to receive tokens above what they have staked plus the predefined bonus accruals.",
