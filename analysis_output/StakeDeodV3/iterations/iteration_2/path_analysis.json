  "code_path": "The critical path begins in the stakeTokensV3 function where deposits are recorded (in depositInfo and userDepositIds) with parameters such as depositAmount, timePeriodInDays, and monthlyPercentage (set from releasePercentageFromDays mapping). The flow then continues into availableAmountForClaim, where for each deposit the available amount is computed using the elapsed time (calculated as (block.timestamp - depositInfo[x].depositedTimestamp) divided by 30 days) and the stored monthlyPercentage. Finally, withdrawTokensV3 uses this computed amount to transfer tokens to the user.",
  "analysis_focus": "Variables on which the withdrawal calculation depends: the depositInfo[x].depositedTimestamp as the start time for the staking period, and block.timestamp as the current time. In addition, the monthly release bonus (stored in releasePercentageFromDays and copied into depositInfo[x].monthlyPercentage at staking) is an important parameter. Since the admin controls these bonus settings via setReleasePercentageV3 and setReferalPercentageFromDaysV3, these mappings are another key focus area.",
  "manipulation_strategy": "1. Although depositInfo[x].depositedTimestamp is set automatically via block.timestamp when staking, a miner can slightly adjust block.timestamp within consensus rules to change the computed numberOfMonths for a deposit, thereby marginally increasing (or decreasing) the per-deposit availableWithdrawal amount. 2. The admin-controlled bonus parameters (releasePercentageFromDays and getReferalBonusFromDays) could potentially be set to extremely high values if administrative safeguards or governance mechanisms are weak. An attacker with control over the admin role \u2013 or an attacker influencing the admin through misconfiguration \u2013 could set the bonus percentages to unreasonably high values, which would then be used in the computation of per-month bonus amounts in availableAmountForClaim.",
  "expected_impact": "Small manipulations of block.timestamp or depositInfo[x].depositedTimestamp could slightly alter the number of recognized 30\u2010day periods, thus marginally affecting the computed available claimable tokens. More significantly, if bonus percentages (monthlyPercentage and referralPercentage) are set to very high values through administrative misconfiguration, users (or an attacker with a staked position) could withdraw far more tokens than intended, potentially draining the contract\u2019s token balance.",
  "assumptions": "It is assumed that the admin role has the capability to update bonus parameters without enforced limits and that miners can slightly influence block.timestamp within acceptable bounds. It is also assumed that there is no additional runtime check or external governance mechanism strictly limiting the bonus settings.",
