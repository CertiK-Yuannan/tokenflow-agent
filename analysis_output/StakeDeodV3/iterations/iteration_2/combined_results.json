The flow then continues into availableAmountForClaim, where for each deposit the available amount is computed using the elapsed time (calculated as (block.timestamp - depositInfo[x].depositedTimestamp) divided by 30 days) and the stored monthlyPercentage.

In addition, the monthly release bonus (stored in releasePercentageFromDays and copied into depositInfo[x].monthlyPercentage at staking) is an important parameter. Since the admin controls these bonus settings via setReleasePercentageV3 and setReferalPercentageFromDaysV3, these mappings are another key focus area.",

Once set, any staker (or the attacker themself with a small deposit) can withdraw a multiple of their staked amount. In addition, because the withdrawal amount depends on the elapsed time computed using block.timestamp and the original deposit's timestamp, a miner (or colluding participant with some control over the staking time) may slightly alter block.timestamp (within allowed bounds) to claim monthly bonuses slightly earlier, marginally increasing the claimable amount. While the timestamp manipulation impact is minor, the admin\u2010controlled bonus parameters are completely unchecked, which permits a scenario where an attacker (or a malicious admin) can drain contract funds by inflating bonus values.",
    "exploit_code": "1. As admin, call:\n   setReleasePercentageV3(90, 10000) // For a deposit period of 90 days, set a monthly release bonus of 10000 (instead of a modest value).\n   setReferalPercentageFromDaysV3(90, 5000) // Similarly, set referral bonus abnormally high if desired.\n\n2. As the attacker, stake a small amount of tokens:\n   stakeTokensV3(100, attackerAddress, 90) \n   // This records a deposit with depositAmount = 100, monthlyPercentage = 10000.\n\n3. After approximately one month (or by manipulating block.timestamp slightly via miner influence if possible), call:\n   withdrawTokensV3(attackerAddress)\n\n4. The available amount is calculated as:\n   numberOfMonths * (depositAmount * monthlyPercentage / 1000), which becomes (1) * (100 * 10000 / 1000) = 1000 tokens. \n\n5. Withdrawing now returns 1000 tokens for an initial deposit of 100 tokens. Repeating this cycle (or waiting until maturity to get the full multiplier) drains a larger than expected amount of tokens from the contract.",
    "profit_mechanism": "By setting bonus percentages to extremely high values, the per\u2010month bonus calculation in availableAmountForClaim multiplies the user\u2019s staked tokens by a factor that far exceeds the original deposit. The attacker profits by receiving a withdrawal amount that is orders of magnitude higher than what was staked, thus potentially draining the token balance held by the contract.",
    "attack_prerequisites": "Either an attacker must control the admin account or be able to influence the admin to set abnormal bonus parameters. In addition, if the attacker is a miner or has influence over block.timestamp, they may get a minor edge in adjusting the number of recognized 30-day periods. Finally, the attacker must be a staker or sponsor a staker such that the referral bonus mechanism may be exploited.",
    "attack_limitations": "Timestamp manipulation is inherently limited by consensus rules (only a few seconds can be adjusted) and only provides a marginal gain. The more significant vulnerability requires admin misuse; thus, if robust governance and multisignature checks were in place for updating bonus parameters, the possibility for exploit would be greatly reduced. The contract does not enforce any upper limits on bonus values, so if proper safeguards are implemented, this exploit route would be blocked.",
    "confidence": "high",
    "reasoning": "The critical computation in availableAmountForClaim depends on a monthly bonus factor that is taken directly from the deposit record and is set by an admin-controlled mapping. Since no sanity checks or maximum limits are enforced, an admin can configure these bonus percentages to be arbitrarily high. Once set, a staker can claim more tokens than initially deposited. Although block.timestamp is slightly manipulable by miners, its impact is negligible compared to the potential effects of abnormal bonus settings. Thus, the vulnerability is real and would allow an attacker (or a malicious admin) to profit by effectively draining the contract\u2019s token reserves.",

This means that a malicious or compromised admin could set these parameters to extremely high values, causing the bonus calculation in availableAmountForClaim to yield a withdrawal that far exceeds the original deposit. Although the effect of timestamp manipulation is marginal, the vulnerability chiefly stems from the admin\u2019s ability to abuse these parameters. The described attack scenario is realistic provided that admin privileges are misused or insufficiently protected, and the calculation indeed multiplies the bonus as described in the exploit explanation.",
    "critical_flaws": "There are no fundamental flaws in the reasoning regarding how the bonus values affect the withdrawal calculation.
