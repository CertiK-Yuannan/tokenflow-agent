    "attack_scenario": "After a careful review of the pseudocode, there is no feasible attack scenario that lets an attacker manipulate the supplied variables to extract extra tokens for profit. The deposit amount and staking period are used in a straightforward way to compute a bonus that is directly proportional to the amount deposited, and the token transfers are made via SafeERC20's safeTransferFrom and safeTransfer methods. In addition, the bonus calculation (including the full withdrawal of principal after maturity) is computed deterministically and all state changes (such as updating withdrawnAmount) are performed before executing external token transfers.",
    "exploit_code": "N/A",
    "profit_mechanism": "N/A",
    "attack_prerequisites": "For an attack to be feasible, an attacker would need to be able to modify the behavior of the external IERC20 token contract (or alter the safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom functionality) or break the arithmetic logic for bonus accrual. Under the assumptions provided \u2013 that the external dependency is immune to manipulation and does not use a low\u2010level .call \u2013 there is no vector available to create a profit.",
    "attack_limitations": "All computations (depositAmount, timePeriodInDays, bonus calculation) are based on user inputs and admin\u2010defined mappings. There is no manipulation possible by splitting deposits, reordering transactions, or abusing reentrancy (given the safeTransfer functions used and the assumption about the external token).",
    "edge_cases": "Edge cases such as choosing a staking period that is not a multiple of 30 days merely result in a lower (or truncated) bonus because maturityMonths is computed via integer division. In no case can an attacker obtain more tokens than the contract is entitled to pay out (i.e. deposit principal plus the computed bonus).",
    "confidence": "high",
    "reasons_if_not_feasible": "The potential vulnerability paths \u2013 such as reentrancy, miscalculation of bonus due to improper handling of deposit variables, or manipulation of the SafeERC20 transfers \u2013 are either mitigated by the use of a safe token transfer library or require external manipulations (such as admin misconfiguration) that fall outside the scope of this attack. The logic does not expose any intermediate state where user-supplied variables can be manipulated to claim more tokens than allowed.",
    "reasoning": "The analysis began by tracing the flow of a staking operation through stakeTokensV3, where the depositCount and depositInfo are updated, and then noticing that token transfers are handled by safeTransferFrom, ensuring that the user\u2019s tokens are moved securely into the contract. The subsequent bonus calculation in availableAmountForClaim uses only the variables provided by the user (deposit amount and staking period) and admin\u2010controlled mappings for percentages. Since the bonus is directly calculated as a ratio of the deposit and no extra multipliers or state inconsistencies are introduced, there is no mechanism for an attacker to extract tokens in excess of what was deposited plus the precisely computed bonus. Furthermore, the withdrawal process records the withdrawn amount to prevent any double-withdrawal issues. Even when considering nuances such as deposits with non\u2010multiple-of\u201030 time periods or potential rounding issues, the attacker does not gain any advantage, as these only reduce the bonus in some cases rather than inflate it. Overall, under the assumptions provided and given the correct behavior of the external token, there is no viable profit-making exploit.",

    "evaluation": "After a detailed review of the contract\u2019s staking and withdrawal logic, the auditor\u2019s conclusion appears correct under the stated assumptions. The deposit amount, staking period, and bonus percentages are all used in deterministic arithmetic without exposing an intermediate state that would allow an attacker to manipulate the bonus or withdraw more tokens than entitled. All token transfers use SafeERC20\u2019s safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom methods and the bonus accrual is computed strictly based on the inputs and admin\u2010controlled percentage mappings. Although the withdrawTokensV3 function updates the withdrawnAmount state variable only after the token transfer, in the assumed context of a well behaved ERC20 token this does not introduce a vulnerability (the token contract is assumed not to invoke any reentrancy callbacks). Additionally, the bonus calculations and deposit bookkeeping are straightforward, and there is no realistic scenario for an attacker to re-order transactions or split deposits in order to claim extra tokens.",
    "critical_flaws": "None. The analysis correctly identified that under standard ERC20 behavior and the assumptions made regarding external dependencies, there is no exploitable flaw.",
    "overlooked_constraints": "The analysis assumes the external token contract behaves as expected and does not implement any unexpected callback behavior (e.g., as seen in ERC777 tokens). Furthermore, while updating state after the external call in withdrawTokensV3 might raise concerns in some contexts, the assumption of a \u2018safe\u2019 ERC20 token mitigates this risk.",
