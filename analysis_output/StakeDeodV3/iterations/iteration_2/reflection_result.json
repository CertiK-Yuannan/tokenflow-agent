  "evaluation": "After a detailed review of the contract\u2019s staking and withdrawal logic, the auditor\u2019s conclusion appears correct under the stated assumptions. The deposit amount, staking period, and bonus percentages are all used in deterministic arithmetic without exposing an intermediate state that would allow an attacker to manipulate the bonus or withdraw more tokens than entitled. All token transfers use SafeERC20\u2019s safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom methods and the bonus accrual is computed strictly based on the inputs and admin\u2010controlled percentage mappings. Although the withdrawTokensV3 function updates the withdrawnAmount state variable only after the token transfer, in the assumed context of a well behaved ERC20 token this does not introduce a vulnerability (the token contract is assumed not to invoke any reentrancy callbacks). Additionally, the bonus calculations and deposit bookkeeping are straightforward, and there is no realistic scenario for an attacker to re-order transactions or split deposits in order to claim extra tokens.",
  "critical_flaws": "None. The analysis correctly identified that under standard ERC20 behavior and the assumptions made regarding external dependencies, there is no exploitable flaw.",
  "overlooked_constraints": "The analysis assumes the external token contract behaves as expected and does not implement any unexpected callback behavior (e.g., as seen in ERC777 tokens). Furthermore, while updating state after the external call in withdrawTokensV3 might raise concerns in some contexts, the assumption of a \u2018safe\u2019 ERC20 token mitigates this risk.",
